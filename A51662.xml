            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe following Treatiſe of <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgick Obſervations</hi> coming caſually to my hand, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it pathetical to what my proper Genius hath of late years led me to, I could not let it paſs without an <hi>Engliſh Dreſs,</hi> that thereby all thoſe that are born with a Genius fit to underſtand Reaſon (though not inſtructed in the Latine Tongue) may have the advantage of peruſing the Judgement of another harmoniouſly concurring with theirs. For it hath not ſeldom happened that many good Apprehenſions of things have been quickned, and Midwifed into the World by ſuch <hi>Publications</hi> as theſe of
<pb facs="tcp:59518:4"/>our Author, which (otherwiſe) would never have ſeen the Light; but have died and periſhed with the Womb in which they were conceived.</p>
            <p>That the following <hi>Obſervations</hi> are (in my Judgement) likely to prove ſerviceable to my Native Country, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly by this my Undertaking: For I doubt not, but that (after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal) they will be found Conſonant to the Reaſon and Experience of every Rational, Unbyaſſed and Unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Chyrurgeon; but more eſpecially to ſuch, the Foundation of whoſe Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is grounded upon Reaſon and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience onely; not upon a Parrot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, Emperical, and Pore-blind Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>In Phyſick and Chyrurgy the Caſe is the ſame, as in Divinity. For there are ſome whoſe Faith is ſo ſtreight-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that if you ask them the Grounds thereof, their Anſwer will be; They believe as the Church believes; and ſo there's an end of the Argument. But
<pb facs="tcp:59518:4"/>others there are who are not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this Implicite Faith, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion being grounded on right Reaſon and Experience. Such is the true Chyrurgeon, that maketh not the leaſt Application to any part or Member of the Body, but can give a Reaſon Anatomically (or diſtinctly) why and wherefore, he doth the ſame: otherwiſe he deſerves not ſo much as the Name of a Surgeon.</p>
            <p>But that this Author was a true <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dico-Chyrurgeon,</hi> is plainly apparent by his curiouſly delineated Obſervations, which (I am ſure) are neither obſcure nor dark to the Ingenious. For his highly-to-be-commended Doctrine of the power of <hi>Alcalies</hi> over <hi>Acidums,</hi> is of ſo great uſe and energy, that all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Practitioners will confeſs (if they have made any Obſervations on their own Practice) that there is no Dolour whatſoever, incident to the Body of Man, that hath been by them ſubdued, but the Remedy thereof hath been of an Alcalic-nature; it being
<pb facs="tcp:59518:5"/>apparent to all genuine Artiſts, that Diſeaſes generally take beginning from Darkneſs, Anger, Terrour, or Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, from which all <hi>Acidums</hi> do ariſe; and that the onely means of pacifying theſe Furies are Light, Sweet, Soft, Smooth and Friendly Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Nature of which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed under that general Word <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that I know the Artiſt hath to do, is in the firſt place to conſider and learn what thoſe things are which fall under his Obſervation, that are more or leſs of an Alcalizate Nature; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to underſtand their Power and Operation on <hi>Acidums;</hi> that thence he may be aſcertained of their true Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Doſe: as in caſe of the <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> a piece of a Pound weight of which is capable to draw and hold faſt a piece of Iron of an Ounce or two, but not of a Pound or two. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo Errours often happen, not ſo much in the Medicine it ſelf, as in the miſ-application of the ſame either in Quality or in Doſe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59518:5"/>
            <p>Thirdly, he ſhould conſider the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient or Accident, or both; for <hi>Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dums</hi> are of divers natures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore require <hi>Alcalies</hi> equally differing for their ſubverſion.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place he ſhould likewiſe conſider how to eſchew and relinquiſh all ſuch things as promote Acidity, and excite Anguiſh, as generally do <hi>Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> too frequently uſed, Tents and Dorſils in Wounds, making of large Orifices in Impoſthumes, ſubjecting Wounds and Ulcers to the Air, and all ſorts of unctuous Medicines.</p>
            <p>More might here be added, but to avoid Prolixity I forbear, leaſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance prove too large for the Houſe, concluding with the Authors Apology for what I have done; onely adding that golden Saying of <hi>Van Helmont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whatſoever thou wouldeſt do to the Sick, do firſt to thy ſelf, and in thy Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine ſeparate the Pure from the Impure;
<pb facs="tcp:59518:6"/>by which means thou art made a fit</hi> Agent <hi>for the Adminiſtration of thoſe peculiar</hi> Gifts <hi>and</hi> Endowments <hi>of</hi> Healing, <hi>gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely to them that are</hi> Alchalizated <hi>to the</hi> Fear of God: <hi>Which that we may all be, is the hearty Prayer of thy real Friend,</hi>

            <head>THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN the ſolid Judgment of a generous Mind, all the Goods of Fortune are out-weighed by Truth, which is the true Food of the Soul; which, though moſt ſweet, and an hundred times taſted of, yet never creates any loathing, as Corporeal Foods are wont to do; which the ſweeter they are, the ſooner (if often eaten) prove diſpleaſant to the Palat.</p>
            <p>He that buys Veniſon of another, and eats the ſame well and delicately dreſt, doth (I confeſs) conceive and find in his mind a certain Pleaſure and Delight. But he who exerciſeth Hunting himſelf, follows, purſues, and at length takes an Hart, Boar, Hare, or other Wild Beast, he is not onely
<pb facs="tcp:59518:7"/>delighted, in eating of the ſame well dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but alſo (and indeed more eſpecially) is filled with very great pleaſure, whilſt he follows the flying Beaſt, and (after various labours and difficulties overcome) takes the ſame.</p>
            <p>Even ſo the matter is with Truth, which indeed (when taſted) is ſavoury and grateful to him who receives the ſame from another; but he who imploys himſelf in purſuit of Verity, and in his purſuit at length takes the ſame, muſt needs be filled with greater pleaſure in his purſuing and taking it, than when he feeds upon it.</p>
            <p>He who would rightly exerciſe this hunting of Verity, he ought by ſerious <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,</hi> and an attent Obedience to pure Reaſon, apply to the Chaſe, and warily follow and take the ſame by <hi>Experience.</hi> If any Phyſical or Medicinal Verities (by me purſued) in all theſe Five Decades, have fallen into my Nets, I muſt needs freely acknowledge them to be obtained by the means aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>In the four first Treatiſes I chiefly ſpeak of Simple Caſes; but in the Fifth Decade I proceed to Hiſtories of <hi>Affects</hi> more
<pb facs="tcp:59518:7"/>compounded. For it ſeemed good to me thus to make progreſſion; as in Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick we begin with the number of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, and ſo are devolved to Numbers very much compounded. After the ſame manner in the Mathematick Science, we begin with a Point, and then proceed to a Circle, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle, and other Figures.</p>
            <p>How compounded and perilous thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are, which I have treated of in the Fifth Decade, and how badly they are (for the moſt part) handled by others, I forbear here to mention, entirely leaving the cenſure of this matter to the well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reader.</p>
            <p>But I already ſeem to hear ſome of my intimate friends ſaying to me; Friend, why do you proceed thus in Writing? Ceaſe, forbear, and bid adieu to your Studies, by which you can ſcarcely effect any thing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be very great moleſtation to your ſelf, from Phyſicians, Chyrurgeons, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>To theſe I anſwer: I have not written to ſatisfie others; for I judge that to be wholly impoſſible, ſeeing the Sacred Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes which were written by the <hi>Inſtinct</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59518:8"/>of <hi>GOD</hi> himſelf, are traduced by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Impious and wicked men; which way then ſhall I that am a mere man, and judge nothing that is Humane alien from my ſelf, be able to expoſe any thing to publick view, which ſhall pleaſe, content, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all?</p>
            <p>From what motive then am I induced thus to write? I anſwer; I had attained to the Degree of <hi>Doctor in Medicine,</hi> and was ſometimes ſent for to Sick Perſons; and, notwithſtanding this, in the mean while, I was conſcious to my ſelf with how great Prejudices and Ignorance in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Science my Mind was affected; I was ignorant of many things, and doubted of more. My tender Conſcience daily ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted theſe Words to me: Either whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reject the Medicinal Practice, or with all thy might drive from thee thy own Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, Either one or the other muſt be done, if thou intendeſt to enjoy Tranquility of Mind. What could I do, being conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in ſuch a Labirynth? I turned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and peruſed the Books of ancient Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, but there found very little that could ſatisfie my <hi>Mind</hi> coveting true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<pb facs="tcp:59518:8"/>I familiarly diſcourſed with the Chyrurgeons of this Age; but from them I reaped little or no benefit; for they either could not or would not inſtruct me. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, urged by extream neceſſity, I was compelled my ſelf to diſſipate the Clouds of my own Mind, remove the Prejudices, with which I was blinded, and become my own Inſtructor. And this Inſtruction of my ſelf is onely by me here propoſed in my Writing. This is what according to my Wiſh I have obtained. No other thing did I promiſe my ſelf before, nor do I at this time expect any other.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let the Malevolent abſtain from their Calumnies, with which (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe) they endeavour to blaſt my Repute. I hurt no man, I offend no man, I teach my ſelf, I learn of my ſelf, I am Teacher and Learner in the ſame perſon, I am Teacher and Learner of my ſelf. If I be a Phyſician, it is lawful for me to heal my own Diſeaſes; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence alſo my Ignorance and Prejudices, which are Diſeaſes of the Mind ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perilous, and had already taken ſo deep root in my Mind, as it would be great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence longer to defer the Eradication of them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59518:9"/>
            <p>Therefore take in good part theſe Five <hi>Decades</hi> of <hi>Chyrurgic Obſervations,</hi> which (if <hi>GOD</hi> permit) ſhall hereafter be followed with mere.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of an Ophthalmy induced by a Fungus.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the year 1680, on the firſt day of <hi>August,</hi> a Boy about Twelve years of Age, playing with another, received into his Eyes (through the hollow ſtalk of a Mully-puff or Fuz-ball, which in the Dutch Idiom is called <hi>een boevyſt</hi>) a Fume or Duſt blown by that other Boy, by which in leſs than Two hours ſpace his Eye-lids were ſo ſwetted, that he could not open his Eyes. His Eyes waxed red all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59518:11"/>no otherwiſe than as if they had been covered with a red Cloth, and ſo coloured did the interior Superficies of his Eye-lids alſo appear; which Symptoms were atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with very great dolour. The Patient neglected the uſe of Remedies for two days, and in the mean while the aforeſaid Symptoms increaſed; and beſides theſe, there was a continual Flux of ſharp Tears.</p>
                  <p>A thing to be admired indeed, and which I cannot call to mind I have any where read of. But which way could that Fume excite ſuch horrid <hi>Phoenomena's? Anſwer,</hi> Thus: The Stalk being hollow within, and perforated onely with a very ſmall hole, and alſo outwardly compreſſed on every ſide by the Boys hand, the more volatile and leſs cohering Particles; were forced from within outward; but ſeeing all thoſe could not at once paſs out together, the one urged the other, and ſo were driven out far more ſwiftly: No otherwiſe than as we ſee Water forced out of a Syringe, though the <hi>Piſtil</hi> be but gently (or very ſlowly) thruſt forwards: or as we diſcern by an eaſie compreſſion of the ſides of Bellows, the Air through the Pipe (or Noſe) thereof is driven out with very great force.</p>
                  <p>But ſome one may perhaps ask me, of what nature thoſe duſty Particles are?
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59518:11"/>To him I anſwer, They are <hi>Accido-corroſive,</hi> and ſharply cutting. That ſuch Acid-Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are in this Stalk is ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by the frequent uſe thereof in ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Bloud. For when a ſmall part of this Stalk is put into a ſanguiferous Veſſel woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Bloud is ſtayed, partly by reaſon of the ſtringy Particles folded one within the other, and cloſing the Orifice of the open Veſſel; and partly by reaſon of the Acid-Particles of that hollow Stalk, which coagulate the Bloud, as Milk is coagulated by an Acididity infuſed.</p>
                  <p>Therefore theſe Acid-Particles, with great force driven through the aforeſaid Stalk, deeply penetrated into the Pores of the Eyes, and interior-Superficies of the Eye-lids; and ſo, with their cutting ſides excited the Nervous Fibres (there diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) to a motion more vehement; by which Vehemency the Mind firſt perceived the ſenſe of pain, which was augmented by that Diſtention, which took begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thus: The Pores being obſtructed by the Particles of that Stalk, the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours wanted their natural Exit, and ſo were collected within the ſmall Pipes of the Membranes in the form of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi> which in a very ſhort time waxed ſowre, by reaſon of the Acid-particles of the ſaid Stalk, acting as a Ferment, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than as we ſee any ſowre Ferment
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59518:12"/>(taken in a ſmall quantity) to convert a great maſs of Dough into its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Acid-Particles (I ſay) with the acuteneſs of their ſides, forcibly ſtriking upon the Nervous-Fibres, drew to thoſe parts a more copious influx of Animal Spirits than uſual; whence aroſe certain ſlight Contractions, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding proved ſufficient in ſome meaſure, to impede the Circulation of the Bloud and Humours, circulating through the ſmall Veins of thoſe circulating parts. For they were, in this caſe, helped by the Vapours within the Veins of thoſe parts converted into Water.</p>
                  <p>When the Bloud conteined in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillary Veſſels, and the Humours in the Veins were thus ſtagnized, they likewiſe (in the aforeſaid manner) waxed ſowre and were coagulated, and by that means rendred more unapt for Circulation. Hence it is ſufficiently manifeſt, whence the Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Tumour of the Eyes and Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids had their Original.</p>
                  <p>But whence proceeded that continual efflux of ſharp Tears? From the aforeſaid, the true cauſe thereof is eaſily gathered, and it is thus. Certain Acid-Particles, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from within that hollow Stalk, had entred the Pores of the <hi>Glandules</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrymal Veſſels,</hi> and there, by their irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59518:12"/>exciting certain Convulſions, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually force out Tears: But whence were they imbibed with a more than uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſharpneſs? There is no mortal Man, who (by the taſte onely) finds not Tears to be Saline; wherefore theſe, in their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage with the acid Particles there inherent, were invaded with a certain ſudden Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being by me for ſome ſmall time conſidered of, I ſoon ceaſed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that that Fume ſhould be the cauſe of ſo great Evils thence enſuing; and alſo at that time diſcerned, that the Cure would not be difficult; For I knew that hot Milk coagulated by an Acidity, if dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with, ſome fit Salt, would again be diſſolved in the ſpace of one hour. Like wiſe I knew Vinegar was eaſily deprived of its ſharpneſs, by infuſing <hi>Crabs-Eyes</hi> or <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargyry</hi> therein: Alſo I underſtood the reaſon of that Effervency which is excited by commixion of the Saline Oyl of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> with the Acid Oyl of <hi>Vitriol.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence I concluded, that the Bloud coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by Acidity, might again be made fluid, and the ſowreneſs temperated by <hi>Crabs-Eyes, Lithargyry,</hi> and many other Medicines containing much Salt; ſuch are <hi>White-Vitriol, Gum Ammoniac, Sagapenum, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barum,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I (being called the third day
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59518:13"/>after the Boy was hurt) inſtilled hot into his Eyes ſome Drops of a certain <hi>Collyrium,</hi> compounded of <hi>White-Vitriol,</hi> and other things mixt with convenient Waters; and upon the Eye I applied a Plaiſter of <hi>Gum Ammoniac, Galbanum, Sagapenum, Lithargyry,</hi> &amp;c. ſpread upon a Linnen-cloth. This I changed daily twice, and commanded the Boy ſhould be kept in a dark place; by which means, in the ſpace of two Weeks he recovered his priſtine Sanity.</p>

               <div n="2" type="observation">
                  <head>OBSERVAT. II.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the uſe of an Iſſue, and its way of Operating.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Young Maid Thirteen years of age, had for ſeveral years been afflicted with dolour and redneſs of her Eyes, and tumour of her Eye-lids, which (after ſleep) were cloſed together by a viſcous Humour, concreted into a Roſin-like matter. This <hi>Ophthalmy,</hi> for a long tract of time, was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to be cured by two Surgeons, but not overcome.</p>
                  <p>I being afterwards ſent for, judged the cauſe of the Diſeaſe to be the too great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59518:13"/>of the Bloud, and a Ferment of the ſame nature produced from that Bloud, and firmly inherent in the Pores of the Eyes and Eye-lids, there cauſing the Bloud in the Capillary Veſſels, and the Humours in the ſmall Veins, to become too acid, and be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated and ſtagnized: For from theſe few ſigns it was not difficult to judge of the aforeſaid apparent Symptoms.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, I firmly perſwaded my ſelf that the Maid might ſoon be cured, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that Acidity could be temperated and expelled by the Pores of the Eyes and Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, and that acid Bloud purged out of the Body; wherefore I uſed a <hi>Collyrium,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Medicaments containing much Salt, and beſides that applied to the Eyes a Plaiſter made of like things.</p>
                  <p>But I did little good by this method; for, ſo ſoon as any part of that Ferment was rendred temperate and caſt out, ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a new Ferment, ariſing from the Bloud, ſucceeded in place of the former: Seeing this, I for ſeveral weeks purg'd the maid twice a week, but in vain: At length I found the Aſſertion of the famous <hi>Silvius,</hi> which is written in the firſt Book of his <hi>Praxis,</hi> Chap. 2. in the 26 Section, to be moſt true, <hi>viz.</hi> That there are ſcarcely any purging Remedies (at leaſt known to us) which can purge out acid Humours from the Bloud.</p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59518:14"/>
                  <p>Finding the matter thus, I judged it high time to betake my ſelf to the ſearching out of better Remedies; and whilſt I was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in conſideration thereof, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Experiment came ſeaſonably into my mind, and it is this:</p>
                  <p>When you have a Compound of Water and Oyl mixt, and would ſeparate the one from the other, proceed thus. If you would have the Oyl to paſs through a Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Paper, the Water remaining in the Filter, you muſt firſt anoint the Paper with Oyl; but if you would filter the Water onely, and have the Oyl remain in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, then you muſt firſt well moiſten the Paper with Water.</p>
                  <p>But what is the cauſe of this <hi>Phoenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non?</hi> The Pores in Oyl are otherwiſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured than in Water; therefore that moſt ſubtile matter of the World, which flows through the branched particles of the Oyl, much differs from that which paſſeth through the moiſt and ſmooth particles of the Water. Suppoſe to your ſelf Water put into Paper firſt imbibed with Oyl, and you will eaſily diſcern that the ſame muſt neceſſarily be debarred entrance, by that moſt ſubtile matter, proceeding from the Oyl contained in the Pores of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and not able to enter through the Pores of the Water (otherwiſe diſpoſed) as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by the moſt ſubtile matter of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59518:14"/>unable to enter the Pores of the Oyl inherent in the Paper. But if Oyl haſten to paſs through Paper, before moiſtned with Oyl, then the moſt ſubtile matter of either of them holds parallel, and what paſſeth out from one part, enters through another, and on the contrary. So Oyl ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth to Paper anointed with Oyl, and is filtred through it; and if it happen that any aqueous Particles poured in ſhould in any meaſure obſtruct this Filtration, they muſt be removed to the ſides, and ſo taken away.</p>
                  <p>Often pondering this Experiment in my mind, and the reaſon thereof, I at length cut a ſmall Wound (called a <hi>Fontinel</hi> or <hi>Iſſue</hi>) in the ſick Maids Arm, and kept it open by a-Pea put in and dairy renewed; and by this means many Humours freely circulating through the Veins of the Arms, by reaſon of thoſe paſſages interrupted by the Wound made, concentred in that Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, were changed into <hi>Pus,</hi> and by long ſtaying there waxed acid, and like a ſowre Ferment infected the Pores of the Veins nigh to the Iſſue.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, whenſoever certain bitter, ſweet, or other Particles of the Bloud, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to enter the aforeſaid paſſages, the Pores of which were filled with that acid Ferment, they were repelled by a moſt ſubtile Matter, every way unlike them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59518:15"/>no otherwiſe than as in the above-recited Experiment, we have even now explained; but when the acid Particles of the Bloud approached, they had acceſs without repulſe, and entred the paſſages nigh the Iſſue, which were before infected with the acid Ferment; but if Particles of another nature intruded themſelves, they were repelled by the ſame moſt ſubtile Matter, which admitted the acid Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles (like it ſelf) to enter thoſe paſſages imbibed with Acidity; no otherwiſe than as one Magnet is ſeen to approach to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by reaſon of particular Rays, which proceeding from one Magnet, enter the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without impediment, and ſo exclude all intermediate Air.</p>
                  <p>By this means I happily effected that, which I had before in vain attemped by <hi>Catharticks.</hi> For the Bloud was daily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened of a large quantity of Acidity by the Iſſue; and this Evacuation the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceeded, becauſe what was in the mean time externally allied, rendred the acid Ferment more temperate, and attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it through the Pores of the Eyes and Eye-lids, which (being too much enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and diſtorted) were again reſtored to their natural ſtate by gentle Aſtringents. This laſt work I effected with a <hi>Cataplaſm,</hi> prepared onely of <hi>Wild-Tanſey</hi> or <hi>Silver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed,</hi> boiled unto ſoftneſs in Water.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59518:15"/>For this Herb contains in it ſelf much volatile Salt, which firſt evaporating from the <hi>Cataplaſm,</hi> did temperate the acid Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and attract it through the Pores; but the more groſs and aſtringent Particles which (beſides its volatile Salt) this Herb poſſeſſeth, came forth laſt, and being gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Aſtringent, cloſed the Pores of the Eyes and Eye-lids as was fit; almoſt after the ſame manner as we ſee Cinnamon and Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meg in a <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> by their volatile and aromatick Salt, firſt to temperate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the Pores of the Bowels, the acid and irritating Ferment; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by their more groſs Particles, with gentle force to conſtringe the (too much dilated) Pores of the Bowels and Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
                  <p>Thus this young Maid, within one month after her Iſſue was made, recovered her priſtine ſtate of health, and ſo remains to this day. After this Maids Cure was in this manner compleated, I cured many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers according to my wiſh.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of a Gangrene.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the year 1680, <hi>September</hi> 7. A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Sixty years of age was ſuddenly afflicted in her Back, Breaſt, and left Arm, with many Bliſters riſing, containing a limpid Water, and very painful; yet in the mean while ſhe could eat well, and was not ſenſible of any internal dolour. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe neglected Remedies for two days, which being elapſed I was called. Then I opened the Bliſters, and found the ſubja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Skin and Fleſh black and gangrenenate.</p>
                  <p>For that very acid and corroſive Ferment lay hid unmoved, and indeed very deep within the Pores of thoſe parts; and whilſt it lay ſo unmoved it could infer no dolour, becauſe pain is excited by motion of the Fibres of the Nerves more than uſual; and the Body being unmoved, another part can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not move.</p>
                  <p>But when that acid corroſive Ferment was expelled from its own Pores, by the Humours (iſſuing from the Pores of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59518:16"/>Arteries, and circulating through the Veins of the Parts) very great dolour was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly excited, and the Humours circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting were ſpeedily coagulated, and by that Ferment changed into a corroſive Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>Now, the more ſlippery, flexile, and ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Particles of thoſe coagulated Humours, were (by the Humours following them) driven up to the Superficies of the external <hi>Cutis,</hi> which (becauſe the Pores were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringed by the cold Air) they could not penetrate, therefore elevated the ſame on high in form of Bliſters; but the more groſs, more acid, and more ponderous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles remained in the bottom, and ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded the ſmall Fibres of thoſe parts, that the circulating Humours could no more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into them; and hence the Gangrene of thoſe parts took beginning.</p>
                  <p>It being now obvious to me, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid corroſive Acidity was peccant in this caſe, I could readily conclude what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies were fit to be applyed, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as I had known to render like Acidities more temperate: And, becauſe I knew that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Nitre, and the Acidity of Salt, would wax ſweet by Spirit of Wine adjoyned, therefore I made a <hi>Lavament</hi> of Spirit of Wine, to which I added <hi>Lethargyry, Crabs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyes, Spirit of Scurvy-graſs, Chalk,</hi> and other things reſiſting Acidity. I often in a day
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59518:17"/>applied this <hi>Lavament</hi> with a Linnen-cloth four double; and in the mean time the Patient every two hours took two Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of the following Mixture (tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Acidity) that part of that coming through the Arteries to the parts affected, might contribute help to the Remedies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally applied.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Uſing this <hi>Lavament</hi> for one day, and finding little benefit by the uſe thereof, I ſcarrified the parts affected, and waſhed them with <hi>Unguentum Egyptiacum</hi> mixt with Spirit of Wine; I did not at all fear any damage to accrew from the Vinegar which is put into this Unguent, becauſe in the boiling that is all evaporated. Alſo I anointed the exteriour Circumferences of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59518:17"/>the affected parts with <hi>Oyl of Tyles,</hi> called <hi>Oyl of Philoſophers.</hi> Laſtly, I applied a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm</hi> of <hi>Rue, Wormwood, Dittany of Crete, Root of Galangal,</hi> and <hi>Calamus Aromaticus, Flower of Lupines, Metheglin,</hi> and other things temperating Acidity.</p>
                  <p>By uſe of theſe aforeſaid Remedies good <hi>Pus</hi> began to be generated, which (by its gently cutting Particles) brake in ſunder the remaining intermediate Fibres, which as yet had retained the dead and living fleſh together, and by this means the parts affected with the Gangrene were ſeparated. Seeing this, I applied <hi>Common Turpentine,</hi> mixt with <hi>Baſilicon</hi> and the White of an Egg, by which all the viſcous Particles were removed, which were otherwiſe wont to obſtruct the Pores of the Arteries, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities of the Veins. By this means ſeveral Particles came forth from the Arteries, and adhered to the Ulcers, by reaſon of the ſimilitude of their Superficies; and ſoon after all the Ulcers were diſcerned to be filled with fleſh: then I applied dry Lint ſcraped, and in a ſhort time induced an Eſchar by that onely. For that imbibed all the <hi>Pus</hi> which otherwiſe would have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded, and wholly cloſed the Orifices of thoſe tender Veſſels.</p>
                  <p>Thus our Patient was compleatly reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to her priſtine ſanity, <hi>Octob.</hi> 21.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of a Sphacelus of the Foot.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Man of Seventy years of age, that had all his life-time devoted himſelf to <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Venery,</hi> and by frequent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals was afflicted with a <hi>Spaſmus</hi> of his right Leg, in the year 1681, <hi>February</hi> 22, was invaded with a ſmall Fever not vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. On the 26th day of <hi>February</hi> his proſtrated appetite ſeemed to return, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on that day he twice eat a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of very ſowre Butter-milk, and the ſame day (about nine at night) he began to complain of a very great pain of his right Foot, and (ſoon after) of a <hi>Stupor</hi> and great coldneſs of the ſame; and the ſame <hi>Dolour, Stupor,</hi> and <hi>Algor,</hi> in two hours ſpace aſcended above the Knee. The 28th of <hi>February</hi> I was called, and by Scarification found, that the <hi>Sphacelus</hi> had aſcended an hands breadth above the Knee; for ſo far was preſent that extream Cold and Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs, and in Scarification no ſign of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour appeared, nor did any Bloud iſſue out, except a very little very black and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59518:18"/>coagulated, breaking out in one part or other.</p>
                  <p>Very attentively conſidering all theſe things, I concluded, that the abuſe of Wine and Venery, had rendred the Bloud of this Man (its more ſubtile and more volatile part being abſumed) too viſcous and acid; and when certain acid and viſcous Particles of this Bloud, were by Circulation come to the right Foot, perhaps they there ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized, and afterward pertinaceouſly adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and by their ſtay there acquired grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſharpneſs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Particles inferred no Dolour ſo long as they remained unmoved; but when by intervals they were forced from their reſidence by the Humours circulating, and by them excited to motion, then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the cauſe of the <hi>Spaſmus</hi> of the right Leg, irritating and cutting the ſmall Fibres of thoſe parts, and ſo gave occaſion to a greater afflux of the animal Spirits.</p>
                  <p>But the continued exceſs of Wine and Venery had left ſcarce any thing in the Bloud of this man, except a <hi>Caput-mort</hi> (as I may call it) that is, nothing beſides Bloud very viſcous and acid, which could no longer duly exerciſe its proper efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in the Heart, nor circulate through the parts; yet this Bloud, when it had by a ſmall Fever received greater motion, and was rarified more than uſual, did ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:59518:20"/>open the Pores of the Arteries, ſo that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny acid and viſcous Particles iſſued out, and ſtayed without; and this hapned rather in the right Foot than elſewhere, becauſe there reſided the acid and viſcous Ferment, which cauſed the Acidity and Viſcoſity contained in the Bloud, to draw nigh to it ſelf in ſuch a way as we explained in the Second <hi>Obſervation;</hi> and perhaps a great cauſe was that abundance of acid Butter-milk eaten, becauſe this happened the 27th day of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> rather than at any other time.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe acid and viſcous Particles that paſſed out from the Pores of the Arteries on the 27th of <hi>February,</hi> ſetled in the Veins of the right Foot, and conjoyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the acid Ferment therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and there (by the acuteneſs of their ſides) impreſſed on the ſmall Fibres a very vehement motion, and ſo produced that Dolour; but the ſmall Fibres, being not long able to ſuſtain that violence, were ſoon after wholly cut in ſunder, and by that means the ſenſe of pain, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Scarification then made, was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally annihilated, and the broken Fibres (infolding themſelves each within the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) had ſo obſtructed the veiny paſſages of the right Foot, that the Bloud and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits could not enter; this was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the coagulation of Humours in the Foot, produced by the aforeſaid Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59518:20"/>Hence I diſcerned the Original of the <hi>Sphacelus</hi> of his right Foot: alſo that it muſt needs take beginning from Acidity, is confirmed by that black and coagulated Bloud which in ſcarifying had its Exit: For every man knows, that the Bloud wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth black and is coagulated by Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Sphacelus</hi> had by this time tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Knee, and ſoon after (a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the part affected) the Patient felt an intolerable pain.</p>
                  <p>I, conſidering with my ſelf the fore-paſſed deſſolute Life of the Sick-man, his Age, his Leg above the Knee infected with this <hi>Sphacelus,</hi> and his whole Maſs of Bloud grievouſly tainted; and moreover calling to mind that I never knew any Old men infected with this Diſeaſe to eſcape, did boldly predict the inevitable death of the Patient; yet in the mean while I promiſed I would mitigate the dolour as much as I could, and (if poſſible) prevent the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſcent of the evil.</p>
                  <p>In order hereunto, I commanded the Patient ſhould every two hours take two ſpoonfuls of a mixture tempering Acidity, conſiſting of <hi>Borrage</hi> and <hi>Bugloſs-water, Treacle-water, Sugar-perlate, Crabs-Eyes, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Mineral Bezcardic,</hi> and other things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringing Acidity, and attenuating Viſcoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59518:21"/>
                  <p>Alſo I cauſed a Decoction to be made, conſiſting of <hi>Water, Wine, Roots</hi> of <hi>Calamus Aromaticus,</hi> and <hi>Enula Campane,</hi> with <hi>Rue, Dittany of Crete, Wormwood, Flower of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines,</hi> &amp;c. which I applied hot with a double Cloath; by which Application ſome eaſe of pain was induced: For the Acidity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing dolour by its accuteneſs, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by rendred more temperate. Therefore when the Cloath was dry, I again moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it in the ſame Liquor; and this reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Application I continued for ſeveral days.</p>
                  <p>Now, when the 7th day of <hi>March</hi> was come, I ſaw that Down or <hi>Moſſy Lanugo</hi> (which is vulgarly called <hi>Mouldineſs</hi> or <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor</hi>) diſperſed through the whole internal part of the Leg, from the Ankle to the Knee; and had I at that time had at hand a good <hi>Microſcope,</hi> I might have there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned many Plants, with their Stalks, Leaves, and Flowers, in excellent order diſpoſed, ſpringing up from the Leg of the man yet living, no otherwiſe than as a <hi>Fungus</hi> (or <hi>Muſhroom</hi>) is wont to ariſe from the Earth.</p>
                  <p>The Sick-man in the mean while eat not any thing, and was every day afflicted with a Fever often coming and vaniſhing. At length on the 14th day of <hi>March,</hi> at four in the Morning he ſlept well, his Pulſe before death often intermitting, which alſo
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59518:21"/>may eaſily be underſtood to proceed from Acidity.</p>
                  <p>But his whole Maſs of Bloud was infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, therefore here <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> could in no wiſe be admitted; for three days before the Sick-man died, his left Foot alſo (from the great Toe to the Ankle) was infected with a <hi>Sphacelus;</hi> and both his hands for 24 hours before his death were cold as Ice, though after return of the Fever they again waxed warm.</p>
                  <p>Now, that to this Evil I applied conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Remedies, will (I ſuppoſe) be very apparent by this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Sphacelus,</hi> which at firſt (good advice being negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted) had, in four hours ſpace aſcended from the great Toe to above the Knee, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the application of my Remedies, had not aſcended in the ſpace of two Weeks above one hands breadth.</p>

                  <p>In ſome ſolid part of this man lay hid a a certain acid Ferment, which (by ſome cauſe or other) was thence expelled and forced into the Maſs of Bloud, in which it excited that Inimical Fermentation, which is known by the name of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>But when that Ferment was circulated with die Bloud, perhaps certain Particles thereof ſtagnized, and inhered within the <hi>Cutis</hi> of the right Leg; which Particles in a ſhort time, compelled all the other Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of that acid Ferment to recede from the Bloud and approach to them, almoſt after the ſame manner as one Magnet cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth another to approach to it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Particles there inherent, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently corroding the ſmall Fibres, exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted dolour in the Leg: But the Redneſs took beginning from the Bloud ſtagnized in the Capillary Veins, by reaſon of the coagulation beginning and proceeding from Acidity; as we perceive a ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe redneſs in the Face, when the Neck and Veins there contained are by a Collar (or any other thing) too much conſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>

                  <p>A Virgin aged Forty years, having for a long ſeries of time devoted her ſelf to an ill habit of Diet; and, among other inimical Foods, ſhe too much delighted to eat things viſcous, Vinegar, and other ſowre things, in the Summer-ſeaſon alſo often put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her Feet into cold Water; ſhe had now for Fifteen years been afflicted with a <hi>Varix</hi> of her left Leg, extending it ſelf from the Sole of the Foot up to the Knee; and alſo with two Ulcers (nigh the inward Ankle of the ſame Leg) deep, ſordid, and very dolorous, and for the moſt part filled up to the top with a certain ſharp and thin matter, and often having round about them
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59518:23"/>an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> attending. Many Phyſicians and Chyrurgeons, for a long time in vain attempted the cure of theſe Ulcers; yea, alſo that moſt famous Practitioner of <hi>Feium,</hi> Lord of <hi>Cranenburg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the too great quantity of acid and viſcous Meats aſſumed, the Bloud of this Maid was rendred groſs and apt to ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize; wherefore a certain portion thereof, conveyed to the left Leg, there ſtayed and reſided about the ſmall Valves of ſome Vein, the Membranes of which, by a great abundance of Bloud (there congeſted) were ſo diſtended, that the Humours paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out from the ſmall Arteries, diſperſed among the Membranes of that Vein (for among the Membranes of the Veins, you may by a <hi>Microſcope</hi> diſcover ſmall Arteries, Veins, and Nerves, and undoubtedly there are alſo preſent ſmall <hi>Lymphatick</hi> Veſſels) and wandring through the ſmall Cavities of the ſame Membranes, could not freely paſs, but ſtagnized there, and thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves between the <hi>Interſtitiums</hi> of the ſmall Fibres, in ſo great abundance, that they not onely enlarged thoſe <hi>Interſtitiums,</hi> but alſo denied paſſage to the Animal Spirits from the ſmall Nerves, gliding into the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid ſmall Cavities, and otherwiſe in ſome ſort conſtringing the Vein, and in it producing a certain <hi>Periſtaltick motion,</hi> for promoting the Circulation of the Bloud
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59518:23"/>in the Vein; and ſo the Bloud in that Vein (in ſome ſort) ſtagnizing, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove meaſure diſtending the Membranes thereof was the cauſe of the aforeſaid <hi>Varix.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why ſhould that <hi>Varix</hi> rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſelf to ſight in the Leg than elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where? I anſwer: Becauſe die Veiny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloud muſt there aſcend, by a Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular way, to the Horizon; and beſides, this way is in ſome meaſure cloſed up by the Garters we are wont to uſe to retain and keep up our Stockings; ſo alſo the ſame was here occaſioned by this Maids too often putting her Feet into cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Bloud, in greater abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance than was fit, congeſted in this Vein, diſtended the leſs reſiſting parts of the Membranes of the ſame more than other more groſs parts, and ſo formed to itſelf certain Receſſes, and eſpecially about the ſmall Valves, in which die Bloud (now of its own nature become much too acid) contracted to it ſelf a greater <hi>Acor,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſtay'd too long there without Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation.</p>
                  <p>But many of the more acid Particles of this Bloud penetrated the more diſtended (and conſequently more rare) parts of die <hi>Varix;</hi> that is, through thoſe Receſſes, and ſo the ſmall Fibres being there irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59518:24"/>and afterwards cut in ſunder, great do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour was excited, and ſoon after two very painful Ulcers, which by the breaking of more-ſmall Fibres, were rendred very deep.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe acid Particles, pertinaciouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering in the pores of the Lips and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of the Ulcers, they converted the as yet ſincere Humours into acid; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable to continue their Circulation, were (by the Humours continually fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them) forced outwards into the Cavities of the Ulcers, which they uſually filled almoſt up with a ſharp acid and thin Humour; yet not ſo thin, but that (in the mean while) certain more viſcous and more ſtringy Particles were mixt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; which, with their ſtrings (entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled each within the other, and ſticking in the Superficies of the Ulcers) rendred them very ſordid.</p>
                  <p>Thus far we have explained how certain and acid Particles have paſſed through the aforeſaid Receſſes unto the near adjacent Fleſh; now 'tis time to obſerve that many more acid Particles were, from thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, forced into the ſanguineous Maſs, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating with which they entred into the Ulcers, rather than into other parts, by reaſon of the acid Ferment lurking there, after the ſame manner as we ſhewed in the Second <hi>Obſervation:</hi> Thus was the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59518:24"/>of acid Humour (filling the Ulcers, and from them proceeding) aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> which for the moſt part ſurrounded the Ulcers, derived its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal alſo from the Acidity there inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
                  <p>When I had for ſometime well weighed all theſe things in my mind, I at length converted my endeavour to the cure of the <hi>Varix,</hi> (as the firſt Original of the Evil) which, if in things profitable it be lawful to uſe the Terms of Art, may be called the <hi>Procatartick</hi> or primitive Cauſe; therefore from the <hi>Varix,</hi> opened with a Lancet, I drew forth ſeveral ounces of ſtagnized Bloud, acid and black.</p>
                  <p>Then I proceeded to the ſanguineous Maſs, infected with the acid Ferment, which may be called the anticedent Cauſe (according to the ſubtilty of die Wits of our time, which more regards the Pomp of vain Words, than things themſelves) and by a good Diet inſtituted began to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect that (prohibiting all things viſcous and acid) by a Powder temperating Acidity daily taken, conſiſting of ℈j. of <hi>Crabs-eyes,</hi> and the ſame quantity of <hi>White Coral.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this I ſet about the Ulcers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in the bottoms and Lips whereof lay hid an acid Ferment, which (if it be the pleaſure of ſome) may be called by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59518:25"/>the Name of a Conjoyned Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The principal thing that remained for me to do, was to temperate and remove that Ferment, and gradually and without ſenſe to depreſs the Lips of the Ulcers to the bottom; for from this laſt buſineſs I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to my ſelf a threefold Utility.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> I knew that the cavities of the Ulcers being thus removed, none of that acid, and at leaſt in ſome part Viſcous, Humour could be there collected, which by reaſon of its viſcous and ſtringy Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, had before rendred the Ulcers ſordid, and (through its acid and cutting Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles) daily more and more excavated them; there being always in the Cavities of them a great abundance thereof conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually congeſted. But if this Humour have acceſs to the Ulcers, it muſt be caſt out preſently after its coming there, to the ſides of the Ulcers, their Lips being ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depreſſed by ſome hard and heavy Body ſuperpoſited.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I was certain by this means to reſtore the Circulation of the Bloud and Humours, in which is ſited a great part of the cure of Ulcers: For the Lips of the Ulcers being not prominent (as before) over the Superficies of the bottoms, I could diſcern it was poſſible to be effected, that the Humours (circulating through the ſmall paſſages contained in the Lips of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59518:25"/>Ulcers) which before, by reaſon of thoſe paſſages obſtructed, did flow into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities of the Ulcers, would now find out their own way through other paſſages in the bottoms of the Ulcers, and ſo again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their Circulation, which cannot (as before) be impeded by the ambient Air, becauſe that is ſufficiently repelled by the ſame body which depreſſeth the Lips of the Ulcers, that being ſufficiently thick, ſolid, and hard, to anſwer my purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In cure of <hi>Ulcers</hi> and Wounds, I have often obſerved, that an <hi>Eſchar</hi> to be generated never took beginning from the Center or any adjacent parts of Ulcers or Wounds; but always begun from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the ambient <hi>Cutis,</hi> by reaſon of the ſimilitude of Superficies which is found between the <hi>Cutis</hi> and the <hi>Eſchar.</hi> Hence I firmly perſwaded my ſelf, that the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, firſt freed from their acid Ferments and Filths, and rendred plain in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid manner, (their priſtine <hi>Circulation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtored) would in a ſhort time be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with an <hi>Eſchar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore I prepared certain fit Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments (temperating Acidity) to reſiſt the peccant Ferment, lying hid in the Ulcers; and that (as the ſaying is) I might with one Bruſh whiten too Walls, I formed of them two Cakes, ſufficiently hard and thick, and ſomewhat larger than the Ulcers, ſo that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59518:26"/>they would alſo cover a ſmall part of the Lips, and thoſe I laid upon the Ulcers, and with a ſufficiently ſtrict <hi>Ligature</hi> firmly bound them on, and left them ſo for 12 hours; which being elapſed, I could ſoon diſcern, that the hope I had of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived failed me not: For I found the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers wholly plain, freed from all filths, and conſpicuous, with a pleaſing redneſs, and little or nothing painful. Whereby, being almoſt wrapt into admiration, I concluded that the acid Ferment in the Ulcers for the moſt part was, and the remainder would in a ſhort rime be temperated.</p>
                  <p>After a few days, Circulation being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, certain well-known Particles, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out through the Pores of the ambient <hi>Cutis,</hi> firmly adhered to the extremity thereof, having a like Superficies with the <hi>Cutis</hi> it ſelf. Thus we plainly underſtood the certain Rudiment of that <hi>Eſchar,</hi> which had in the ſpace of five Weeks fully clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed either Ulcer; for it every day increaſed more and more.</p>
                  <p>Afterward I every year once opened the aforeſaid <hi>Varix,</hi> and drew from it <hi>lib.</hi> j. of Bloud, by which means thoſe Ulcers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after opened any more.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, to the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> which I had almoſt forgot, I applied a four-doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Cloath moiſtned in a mixture prepared with <hi>Water of Elder-Flowers, Spirit of Wine,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59518:26"/>Camphire,</hi> and <hi>Saccharum Saturni,</hi> for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating the peccant Acidity, which being effected, all Symptoms of the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> ceaſed, together with the burning before induced by the acid Particles, when with the acuteneſs of their ſides they, oftner than uſual, invade the ſmall Fibres.</p>
                  <p>But whence was it that theſe Ulcers could not be healed in ſo great a ſpace of time, by ſo many Phyſicians and Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, though men well in years? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: Thoſe men, by reaſon of their age, contemning the ſolid Reaſonings of others, would never approve of any thing but their own experience.</p>
                  <p>Experience without true Reaſon can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit little: For as among a thouſand humane Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, no one is found exactly in all things like to another; ſo among ſo many <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> there is not one which in all things wholly agrees with another. Moreover it is very credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Bloud and internal Parts of one man do no leſs differ from the Bloud and internal Parts of another than the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. Whence again ariſeth the various Temperament of men, the variety of which requires various Remedies, and (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Experience</hi>) ſound Judgement in the Phyſician; that he may know how to make choice of this or that, and other Remedies inſtead of either.</p>
                  <p>Now, plainly to ſhew the <hi>Caſe</hi> as it is,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59518:27"/>thoſe Phyſicians and Chirurgeons, directing their Conceptions according to a certain vain and unprofitable <hi>Theory</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> could neither find out the Cauſe of the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rix</hi> nor its Effects, much leſs the Remedy of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>For they deduced almoſt all Diſeaſes from their <hi>Four Humours,</hi> viz. <hi>Choler, Phlegm, Bloud,</hi> and <hi>Melancholy;</hi> though in the mean time they underſtood not what any one of them is, or of what Particles it conſiſted. Hence it came to paſs, that it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to find out true Remedies. They had much more prudently acted, if they had in a ſpecial manner had reſpect to the various Particles of the Bloud, which differ each from other in Figure, Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and Motion; as alſo to the Acidity and Salt (as well as they might have done) whether of theſe holds dominion in the Bloud: If it were Acidity, then Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the Belly could in no wiſe be thought convenient.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, they too much confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their Conceptions, when they thought thoſe Ulcers were firſt to be cleanſed by certain peculiar Medicaments, then by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers incarnated: laſtly, that (again) by others the <hi>Eſchar</hi> muſt neceſſarily be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Now that this too anxious diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is very unprofitable, will be plainly evident by this, <hi>viz.</hi> That I, with my one
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59518:27"/>onely <hi>Placentula</hi> in a ſhort time cured both Ulcers.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe they in the Cure had reſpect to their own <hi>Axiom,</hi> which ſaith, <hi>Contraries must be cured by Contraries;</hi> and diſcerning great heat in the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> ſurrounding the Ulcers, they endeavoured to expel that by cold things which ſtopped the Bloud and Humours, and by that means did in no ſmall meaſure augment the burning hear of the <hi>Eryſipelas:</hi> But theſe men were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed by their own <hi>Axiom;</hi> which had they endeavoured to make a right uſe of, they ſhould firſt have conſidered that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Heat to be onely the Effect, and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Cauſe certain acid Particles, by reaſon of Obſtruction inherent about the Ulcer, which (with their cutting ſides) ſtruck the Nervous Fibres with a more than uſual trembling, and then they had more rightly cured <hi>Contraries</hi> with <hi>Contraries,</hi> viz. applying ſuch things which they had by experience found fit to reſiſt the corroding Acidity, and remove the Viſcoſity obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of a Wound of the Eye.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the year 1680, on the 21th day of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> I was commanded to be ſent for by a young Nobleman leading a Military life, who three days before was wounded with a Leaden-Bullet, in that part of the left Eye which is between the <hi>Iris</hi> and <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil;</hi> ſo that the Bullet had penetrated even into the Eye, and ſoon after the Wound made, no ſmall quantity of aqueous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour flowed out. I found the Orifice of the Wound cloſed with a certain fibrous and white Matter. The <hi>Iris</hi> with the <hi>Pupil</hi> wounded waxed very livid, and the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the Eye (thus hurt) was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſly red and ſwoll'n, attended with bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Heat, and a proflux of ſharp Tears. The dolour was continual, except that it was more remiſs, when the Patient held his head backward; but as oft as he held his head down the pain augmented. The Sight of the Eye hurt was wholly loſt, and the right Eye (though it remained untou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched) was red and much pained. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59518:28"/>
                     <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> to that matter, cloſing the Wound, had applied ſharp things, and to the remaining part of the Eye cold things: This was done three days before I was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
                  <p>It will perhaps ſeem ſtrange to ſome, that all the aqueous Humour iſſued not out by the Wound; but their wonder will ſoon ceaſe after they have well weighed and conſidered the following Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Let them conſider, that the Bullet (in its inferiour part) was more ſtrongly forced into the Eye than in its ſuperiour part; and ſo it broke the inferiour part of the Membrane of the Eye, the ſuperiour part of that Membrane remaining entire. By this means part of the Membrane bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken turning inward, formed a certain <hi>Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> through which part of the aqueous Humour iſſued out, and in its efflux again turned outward the before turning inward Membrane, which then like a <hi>Valve,</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from without to within, not from within outward, again cloſed the <hi>Aperture</hi> of the Wound, and ſo impeded the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of the aqueous Humour from die Eye.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That fibrous and white ſhining Matter cloſing up the Orifice of the Wound, falls under our conſideration. But whence had this Matter its Original? Should I now, with the Company of vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly-learned
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59518:29"/>men, fly to the accuſtomed <hi>Aſylus</hi> of Ignorance, I could readily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn a Reply, ſaying onely, that Nature was ſo provident in this caſe, that ſhe in a ſhort time filled up the hole with fit Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; not onely that all the aqueous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour might not iſſue out, but alſo that the moſt cold ambient Air might not pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate to the parts and endamage them. But ſuch an Anſwer ſeems to me no leſs rediculous, than if I ſhould ask; why in boyling hot Broath expoſed to the Air a thin Skin is generated on the Superficies? And another ſhould anſwer; The nature of the Broath is ſo provident, that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently forms a <hi>Pellicle</hi> on the Superficies of the hot Broath, leſt the cold Air, having acceſs to the internal Particles, ſhould hurt them; and that the heat in the Broath might be longer preſerved, and (the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe flying) Vapours retained and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringed within the Broath by the ſuperpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited Membrane; whereas he ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have ſaid, that many of the more thin parts of the Broath, apt for motion, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving figures fit for the ſame, eaſily evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into the Air, and in their flight car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with themſelves up to the Superficies of the Broath, certain Particles more groſs, ſtringy, and leſs fit for motion, which (their motion being terminated by the ambient Air) acquieſced in the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59518:29"/>of the Broath; where, with their ſmall Fibres, folded one within another, they concreted into that <hi>Cuticle</hi> which covered the Broath.</p>
                  <p>But, returning to our purpoſe, we ſhall by a better right anſwer in this manner: Some <hi>Particles</hi> paſſed out from the Pores of the Arteries, and circulating in the ſmall paſſages of the Membranes of the Eye, were carried to the end of thoſe paſſages interrupted by the Wound, and ſo indeed the more thin parts evaporated, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain more ſtringy Particles, prolapſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſaid paſſages, their motion (by the extream coldneſs of the Air at that ſeaſon) being taken away, by their ſtringy Fibres infolded themſelves one within the other, and ſo concreted into a certain fibrous and white Matter; not unlike to that, which is often ſeen in that Water, into which flows the Bloud from a Vein of the Foot or Hand.</p>
                  <p>That leaden Bullet could not enter into the Eye, but very much contuſed it, and broak certain ſmall ſanguiferous Veſſels, from which the Bloud flowing (by reaſon of the cold was ſtagnized) and infected the <hi>Iris</hi> and <hi>Pupil</hi> with a livid colour.</p>
                  <p>This Wound could not be made in the Eye but many ſmall Fibres muſt needs be broken, and being broke, retire together into Curls, and ſo obſtruct many paſſages,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59518:30"/>in which the circulating Humours (accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated) did preſs the ſanguiferous Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels nigh, ſo that the Bloud in the Veſſels ſtagnized, whence the tumour and redneſs almoſt all over the Eye had their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>The Bloud ſtagnizing in the Capillary Veſſels, eſpecially that which lay extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate in a ſhort time aſſumed Acidity, and then (with its cutting Particles) ſooner than uſual, and more vehemently ſhook the ſmall Fibres nigh, whence that burning heat and dolour derived their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the acid Particles of the ſame ſtagnized and coagulated Bloud, by their irritation excited certain light Concuſſions in the Glandules of the Eye; whence the Liquors contained in them, <hi>viz.</hi> Tears, were expelled almoſt continually, which were more ſharp than uſual: For they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaline, in their eflux excited a certain ſuddain efferveſcency, with the acid Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Bloud ſtagnized inherent in the paſſages.</p>
                  <p>But the Dolour, of which I ſpake, did not onely proceed from the acid and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Particles, but alſo from the Leaden-Bullet within the Eye, turned now hither and then thither again; and this was that Dolour which remitted when the Patient held his head backward; becauſe then that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59518:30"/>
                     <hi>Bullet</hi> lay unmoved, and reſted upon the <hi>Bony Orbit</hi> of the Eye: But when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient inclined his Head to his Breaſt, then a very acute dolour was perceived, becauſe the Bullet was again moved and preſſed the wounded part of the Eye.</p>
                  <p>A great part of the <hi>Pupil</hi> was covered with that fibrous and white Matter, ſo that <hi>Globuli Coeleſtes</hi> the Coeleſtial Globes could not enter through the <hi>Pupil</hi> to excite the ſmall Fibres of the <hi>Optick Nerve</hi> (diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the bottom of the Eye) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man hath cauſe to wonder that the Patient was wholly deprived of the ſight of his wounded Eye.</p>
                  <p>But it may rather be cauſe of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the right Eye, which was not hurt by the Bullet, ſhould in the mean while be vexed with redneſs and dolour; yet I ſhall endeavour to remove this cauſe of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>There is no man but ſometimes experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally finds in himſelf, that one Eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved, he can ſcarcely retain the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unmoved. The reaſon of this is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Animal Spirits ſuddenly paſſing from the Brain, through the Nerves, into the Muſcles of one Eye, can ſcarcely be terminated, but ſome of them will (at the ſame moment of time) paſs into the Muſcles of the other Eye. Whence it is manifeſt, that when one Eye is pained;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59518:31"/>that is, when in it is preſent a more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agitation of the ſmall Fibres than uſual, then I ſay, a greater abundance of Animal Spirits (by reaſon of the Pores in the Brain then more open) muſt needs flow, not onely into the Eye affected, but alſo into the found Eye, in which, by this means, are produced certain light <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> which in ſome meaſure conſtringe the ſmall <hi>Paſſages</hi> and ſanguiferous Veſſels; and by that means the <hi>Circulation</hi> of the Bloud and Humours is in ſome ſort obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, ſo that they in a ſhort time wax acid, and by their cutting Particles infer dolour, which is attended with <hi>Redneſs,</hi> proceeding from the Bloud ſtagnized in the Capillary Veſſels.</p>
                  <p>Things ſtanding thus, I predicted to the ſick Noble-man, an impoſſibility of recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſight of his wounded Eye, in which he readily acquieſced, ſaying, He would give me eternal thanks, provided I could preſerve the fight of his other Eye. This I ſuddenly promiſed him.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, proceeding to the Cure of this Wound, I judged my principal work was to reſtore the Cireulation of the Bloud and Humours impeded, and then to repreſs the external Air, and temperate the Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
                  <p>In order to this, I firſt, for temperating the Acidity, inſtilled hot into both his Eyes
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59518:31"/>ſome few drops of the following <hi>Collyrium</hi> twice a day.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Then I applied to the Eyes two ſmall Bags, filled with <hi>Faenugreek, Hyſop, Lavender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers,</hi> and other things abounding with volatile Salt; afterward, inſtead of theſe, I applied Plaiſters containing much Salt; ſuch as is found in <hi>Gum Ammoniac, Sagape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And at length I ſo bound both Eyes, that they remained unmoved, and kept the Patient in an hot and dark place.</p>
                  <p>But, to take away all occaſion of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which ſome one or other may perhaps conceive, becauſe I had ſo much trouble to cure the right Eye, which was not woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I purpoſe here to ſubjoyn Reaſons (which I judge) ſufficiently valid.</p>
                  <p>I did not this that I have done ſo much in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59518:32"/>reſpect of the right Eye as of the left. For if the right Eye had remained open, the ſick man would often have moved it, and ſeen with the ſame.</p>
                  <p>That external motion of the right Eye ſcarcely ever happened but the left Eye was alſo moved; and hence how much the dolour in the wounded Eye would have been exaſperated, he can eaſily conjecture, who hath at any time experienced with how great dolour a wounded Hand or Foot is moved from place to place.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, if the right Eye had not been cloſed, without doubt it would with the ſight have touched many Objects at one time or other; and that could not have been without the producing of ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal motion <hi>de novo</hi> (by the Celeſtial Globes) in the ſmall Fibres of the Optick Nerve; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe indeed the leaſt fibre in the opticknerve in the right Eye cannot be moved, but at the ſame time the ſmall Fiber of the ſame Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the <hi>Optick Nerve</hi> of the left Eye, muſt neceſſarily be moved alſo. This is evidently apparent by the following Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, which the famous <hi>Rohaultius</hi> alſo uſed in his <hi>Phyſical Treatiſe,</hi> (never to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently commended) but for an end far other than mine. He ſhews the way by which two Images (whereof one is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the right Eye, the other in the left) when they come to the Brain, might
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59518:32"/>give Conception to the Mind of one onely Image.</p>
                  <figure>
                     <figDesc>optick nerves</figDesc>
                  </figure>
                  <p>In this Figure each Eye hath delineated onely five ſmall Fibres, that thereby the matter may be more eaſily conceived. But what is here ſpoken of five ſmall Fibres, may be underſtood of many more, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is no ſmall Fiber of the Optick Nerve of the right Eye can be moved, but
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59518:33"/>the Fiber of the ſame Order in the left Optick Nerve will preſently be moved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. The reaſon is, becauſe theſe Fibres joyn together, and are terminated into one point.</p>
                  <p>Thus, to the right Eye, in a ſhort time, both priſtine Sanity and entireneſs of ſight returned; but the left Eye could not be healed before the Month of <hi>March</hi> in the Year following. About that time all Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and Redneſs paſſed away, the livid colour being long before diſcuſſed. The Bullet ſtuck faſt to one part or other of the Eye, and ſo remained unmoved, and to the Bloud and Humours their free Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was reſtored. And then the Humours, by the Wound interrupted, circulating through thoſe ſmall paſſages, continually depoſited certain Particles to the ſides of the Wound; which Particles, by reaſon of the ſimilitude of the Superficies, did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here and were aglutinated, and ſo formed an <hi>Eſchar,</hi> which covered the Wound, and drove out that fibrous and white Matter. But becauſe it was ſo thick that it prohibited the Celeſtial Lights, therefore the fight of that wounded Eye remained loſt.</p>
                  <p>But in the mean while this Eye (as to bulk) ſcarcely differed from the right Eye, though it had caſt out no ſmall part of the aqueous Humour when the Wound was firſt inflicted, becauſe certain ſmooth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59518:33"/>and ſlippery Particles flowed through the Pores of the Arteries into that Cavity, in which the aqueous Humour is contained, and ſo ſupplied the defect of that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
                  <p>In time of the Cure I always abſtained from cold things, becauſe they obſtruct the very ſmall paſſages and Pores of the Eyes: For the ſame cauſe I here alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject fat things, being ſuch as, with their ſmall Branches, do ſo profoundly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaceouſly infold themſelves within the moſt ſmall Pores of the Eyes, that you cannot (without very great difficulty) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them again.</p>
                  <p>But why could not this Wound be ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner healed? I affirm this happened part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the errour of the Chyrurgeon, and partly of the ſick Lord himſelf.</p>
                  <p>For he too much indulged both Venery and Wine, whence his Bloud was very much diſturbed; and what was ſo diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed (in no ſmall quantity) aſcended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as by a more ſtrait path, and there ſtruck upon the obſtructions of the wounded Eye; which notwithſtanding (by reaſon of their pertinacy) it could not break, and by this means the dolour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, in moſt deep Snow falling from the exceeding cold Air of that Seaſon, he would ſometimes ride, on hunting whole
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59518:34"/>days with his right Eye (againſt my will) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; and hence the <hi>Obſtructions</hi> were rendred yet more pertinaceous and numerous.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chyrurgeon,</hi> who for the firſt three days, applied Medicines to the Wound, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that to that fibrous matter which impeded die afflux of the aqueous Humour (and therefore ſhould not have been taken away) he applied ſharp things, which the Eye it ſelf cannot bear; alſo to the remaining part of the Eye he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied cold things to ſtay the afflux of Bloud and Humours, as he himſelf ſaid. But, are you ignorant (good Sir) that this afflux of Bloud and Humours is to the Eye, and alſo to other parts, both natural and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary? and had your Medicaments ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated according to your wiſh, a <hi>Gangreen</hi> would certainly have immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. You ſee Bloud and Humours (in greater abundance than is fit) to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Eye; but you reaſon amiſs when you think this to be cauſed from a greater afflux than uſual; whereas it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceeds from <hi>Obſtructions</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the reflux of Bloud through the Veins, and of Humours through the Lymphatick Veſſels, whence the Bloud and Humours were, in greater abundance, collected into the Eye, ſtagnized and waxed acid. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhould rather have applied things temperating Acidity, which would alſo
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59518:34"/>have been convenient for taking away the lividneſs of the <hi>Iris</hi> and <hi>Pupil,</hi> produced by the clotted Bloud: For it is certain, that clotted and coagulated Bloud cannot be reſtored by cold things, but are unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly rendred more groſs, and the peccant <hi>Obſtructions</hi> (by this means) not removed, but augmented.</p>
                  <p>But before I put an end to this <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> there remains yet one <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> to be diſcourſed of relating to Wounds.</p>
                  <p>It is undoubtedly true, <hi>That the Cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, the Effect ceaſeth.</hi> But why then the <hi>Sword, Knife,</hi> or any other thing wounding, being taken away, is not the dolour in the wound preſently removed, but ſometimes perſiſts very long? Dolour in the part hurt is not, unleſs there be a Concuſſion of the ſmall Fibres, more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement than uſual, which cannot be unleſs by another body put into motion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what ſhall I ſay of the dolour, which ſometimes is portracted whole days, yea, whole weeks after the Wound is inflicted, when the <hi>Sword, Knife,</hi> or any other thing wounding, hath been long before laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide? Let me circumſpectly conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I can find any thing that can excite the ſmall <hi>Fibres</hi> of the wounded part to a greater agitation than uſual. Behold! I have found it. When certain ſmall Fibres are cut in ſunder by a <hi>Sword,</hi> then ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59518:35"/>they criſp up on heaps, and obſtruct the ſmall paſſages of the wounded parts, ſo that the Humours cannot freely circulate, but ſtrike upon thoſe <hi>Obſtructions;</hi> whence is excited dolour, which ſtill increaſeth, when thoſe Humours begin to wax acid, and (with their cutting Particles) yet more and more irritate. Beſides, many ſmall Fibres, which before were covered with skin, after the Wound inflicted, are expoſed to the ambient Air, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects them with more vehements trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling than is fit, whilſt it communicates ſomewhat to them from its own motion, by which indeed it is continually and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully enough agitated.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of a Suppurated Tumour; alſo of Rottenneſs of a Bone.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Young Maid ten years of Age, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with a burning Fever, ſoon after the Fever felt a pain, and (quickly after that) a Tumour in her Shoulder, which was of the ſame colour with the skin and ſomewhat hard.</p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:59518:35"/>
                  <p>The Bloud more than uſually agitated by the Fever, from the receſſes of this or that ſolid part, waſhed off many acid and viſcous <hi>Particles,</hi> which circulating with the Bloud, did part of them paſs out from the Pores of the Arteries, at that time too much dilated (by reaſon of the heat of the Fever) into the ſmall paſſages about the <hi>Shoulder,</hi> ſited far within the <hi>Cutis;</hi> in which paſſages they adhered and excited dolour, whilſt with their pricking ſides they more vehemently than uſual made a commotion, and by this means in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure diſtorted the bordering paſſages; whence alſo the Humours there ſtagnized, which (though they were before pure) by a ſmall delay there, waxed acid; hence alſo the Bloud ſtagnized in many Capilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Veſſels, but ſo deeply ſited within the <hi>Cutis,</hi> that the redneſs could not be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent through the skin, and therefore appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the ſame colour with the <hi>Cutis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whence was that hardneſs of the Tumour? for it was Liquor that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein; and ſuch liquor, as (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fluid) and gently touched with the hand, offering no reſiſtance, could not be judged either hard or ſoft.</p>
                  <p>A great quantity of liquor is contained in an Apple, and may be preſſed from it; yet in the mean while it is found to be ſomewhat hard, becauſe that Liquor is
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59518:36"/>very much divided, and abides ſeparated in ſeverall ſmall paſſages and Pores of the Apple, diſtinct each from other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the hand touching the Apple meets with the firſt ſmall paſſage; whence the Particles of Liquor (in that contained) do indeed in ſome meaſure recede; but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to the ſubjacent paſſages they find reſiſtance. Hence the hardneſs of the Apple is made manifeſt, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence alſo the hardneſs of the Tumor.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, being perſwaded that in this caſe the viſcous Particles obſtructing, and the acid, cutting, and irritating, I judged nothing could be more conducent for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering them than things aperient and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating Acidity. Wherefore to the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor I applied <hi>Paracelſus</hi> his <hi>Stiptick Plaiſter;</hi> but (I am willing briefly to note this) the Magnet in it ſeemed to me ſuperfluous in this caſe, that being added onely to attract things hurtful to it ſelf. Yet the Magnet cannot draw to it ſelf all bodies without diſtinction, but another Magnet and Iron onely; and it wholly loſeth this attractive power, when reduced to powder (as <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haultus</hi> found by experience) becauſe then the ſtriate Pores are broken. This ſame <hi>Rohaultus</hi> reduced a very good Magnet to powder, which he put into Lint, and rubbed the powder well in to joyn with the ſame, and by Application found the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59518:36"/>priſtine vertues in the Magnet to be totally vaniſhed.</p>
                  <p>But to return to our purpoſe, I left the aforeſaid Plaiſter ſeveral days upon the Tumor, hoping by this means the Acidity would be temperated, and the viſcoſity ſo attenuated, that it might be partly reſtored to its priſtine Circulation, and partly eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated through the Pores of the Skin; but the evil was too pertinaceous, and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated my hope. What was to be done then? The Acidity, with its cutting Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, had broke the ſmall Fibres, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral concave paſſages, ſo that the Liquor in the Tumor contained, flowed all into one place; then the Tumor was no more hard but ſoft, no otherwiſe than as the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor before expreſſed out of an hard Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and received into ſome Veſſel, exhibits it ſelf ſoft to the touch. In that I judge the <hi>Suppuration</hi> made in the Tumor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.</p>
                  <p>Now I ſeem to hear our vulgarly-learned men exclaiming againſt me, ſaying, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not in cure of this diſeaſed Girl ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Art; that is, according to their falſe and unprofitable <hi>Theory,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands firſt of all to apply to Tumors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling Medicines. But this clamour is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſilenced by onely ſaying, that the cauſe of almoſt all Tumors is Obſtruction, which (according to their proper Axiom, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:59518:37"/>that <hi>Contraries are cured with Contraries</hi>) muſt be removed by <hi>Aperients,</hi> but not mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied by repelling Medicaments (vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called) <hi>viz.</hi> by cold and aſtringent Remedies.</p>
                  <p>But what if I ſhould beat the <hi>Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> with their own Weapons, and convince them by two Arguments, that repelling Medicaments (vulgarly ſo called) in the beginning of almoſt all Tumors, very rarely, yea never, can be profitably uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. I will at leaſt attempt it.</p>
                  <p>Their will is, that repelling Remedies be applied in the beginning of Tumors, yet they except two Caſes. The <hi>firſt</hi> is when the Tumor is made by Congeſtion. The <hi>ſecond,</hi> when it is found in an <hi>Emuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the firſt, it is known to every man (not plainly blinded with prejudice) that no Tumor is made by a Fluxion, as ſuch, provided it be natural; but every Tumor is made by Congeſtion; that is, when the flowing of Bloud and Humours is impeded by <hi>Obſtruction,</hi> by reaſon of which the Bloud and Humours muſt be ſomewhere congeſted and accumulated; hence it moſt evidently follows, that repelling Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can never be available in Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</p>
                  <p>As to the other, for brevity ſake, let us take one onely <hi>Emunctory,</hi> by them vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59518:37"/>ſo called. They affirm repelling Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments not ſafe in Tumors of the Groin, becauſe that is the <hi>Emunctory</hi> of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; that is to ſay, becauſe by it the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the Liver are expelled; but this in truth is a moſt falſe reaſon: For the Lymphatick Veſſels conveigh their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Liquor upwards from the Groin, ſo that nothing remains but Nerves and Arteries, through which the Excrements of the <hi>Liver</hi> are depoſited; but though the Nerves eject ſome Excrements by the Groin, yet it doth not follow that that is the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munctory</hi> of the Liver, but rather of the Brain and <hi>Spinal Marrow:</hi> For the Nerves, of which there are very few found in the Liver, receive nothing from it; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by the Arteries (which alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing from the Liver) certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements are driven into the Groin, and by that expelled; the Groin doth not therefore deſerve to be called the <hi>Emun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory</hi> of the Liver, but rather of the whole Maſs of Bloud. Therefore if repelling Medicaments be not to be applied to Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of the Groin, becauſe that is the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munctory</hi> of the Bloud; then by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, it will be unſafe to repel in any other part of the Body; becauſe every where many Particles of the Bloud are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evacuated and exhale through the Pores of the Body.</p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:59518:38"/>
                  <p>But it is now time we ſhould return to the, purpoſe from which we have too far digreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe the Tumor was ripe, and the <hi>Pus</hi> contained therein, ſo deeply ſited, that it could not break through the ſuperpoſited Skin and Fleſh, I therefore made an Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that part of the Tumor, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more ſoft and more eminent; this peared more ſoft and more eminent; this being done, not a little <hi>Pus</hi> iſſued out. But behold! I then found a black and putrid Subject (rendred ſuch by the Acidity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Tumor) which had cut in ſunder the ſmall Fibres of the <hi>Perioſteum,</hi> and after that had corroded the Bone it ſelf, and corrupted its volatile Slat, which is natural to Bones, and is found abounding in them, as is evident by the diſtillation of the <hi>Humane Craneum,</hi> from which is forced out much Spirit, and no ſmall quantity of Volatile Salt in a dry form.</p>
                  <p>But if any man be not as yet fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with theſe my Reaſonings, let him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to his Teeth <hi>Oyl of Vitriol</hi> (which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry acid) and he will by proper experience find them not onely to rot, but alſo to fall out by piece-meal.</p>
                  <p>Yea, this was well underſtood by <hi>Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Hildanus,</hi> that moſt famous and highly-experienced <hi>Chyrurgic-Phyſician;</hi> therefore he, in rottenneſs of the Bone, condemned nothing more than acid <hi>Oyl of Vitriol, Oyl of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59518:38"/>Sulphur, Aqua Fortis,</hi> &amp;c. and indeed deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly.</p>
                  <p>I long ſince knew, that Ulcers attended with rottenneſs of die Bone, could not be healed, unleſs by reſtoring the Bone firſt to its priſtine condition; therefore I here firſt took in hand to cure the periſhed Bone.</p>
                  <p>I alſo was not ignorant, that Fat things were very hurtful to the Bones, becauſe they (with their ſtringy Particles) do ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily obſtruct the ſmall Pores and paſſages of them, and indeed pertinaciouſly enough. For which cauſe I here ſhunned all Fat things, worſe than I would a Dog or Snake, and upon the putrified Bone I ſtrewed <hi>Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Euphorbium,</hi> which contains much Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt, and that indeed very tart. By this means, in a ſhort time all the rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was gradually removed from the Ulcer in form of an impalpable Powder.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Fatneſs</hi> of <hi>Euphorbium</hi> is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid, as ſome perhaps may conjecture, but ſaline, is manifeſt by this, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it ſo vehemently excites <hi>Sternutation,</hi> no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than as <hi>Spirit of Sal Armoniack,</hi> which every man owns to be ſaline. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, apply to your Noſtrils the acid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of <hi>Nitre, Vitriol, Salt,</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and you will find them, though moſt ſharp, yet not to excite <hi>Sternutation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, that with External <hi>Medicaments</hi> I
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59518:39"/>might help the Internal, whilſt I was uſing the <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> I gave to the ſick a Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made with <hi>China, Sarſaparilla,</hi> and other things containing much Volatile Salt.</p>
                  <p>When I ſaw the rottenneſs would not give place to theſe, I applied red-hot Iron which is by ſome called an <hi>Actual Cautery,</hi> to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from that which is called a <hi>Potential Cautery,</hi> but very improperly; For there is no ſuch thing as a <hi>Potential Cautery.</hi> Every <hi>Cautery;</hi> that is, every thing that burns, acts. If that may deſervedly be called a <hi>Potential Cautery,</hi> which though it cannot preſently burn, yet in a ſhort time will effect the ſame; then Ice, by a better right, ſhall be accounted a <hi>Cautery,</hi> becauſe that may be reduced into boiling Water; but how improper ſuch a ſaying is, I leave to the judgement of others.</p>
                  <p>But burning Iron in rottenneſs of a Bone, for two cauſes helps. <hi>First,</hi> it communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates ſo much by its own motion to the Acido-corroſive Ferment (inherent in the Bone) that it can evaporate as <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> is (in diſtilling) by Fire elevated on high. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it can temperate that part of the Acido-corroſive Ferment, which is left in the rotten Bone. For Iron egregiouſly reſiſts Acidity, as is evident in preparation of <hi>Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Mars;</hi> in which is excited a ſufficiently manifeſt Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59518:39"/>when the <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> is infuſed upon the <hi>Filings of Steel;</hi> and ſo in a ſhort ſpace of time the <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> loſeth much of its acor and corroſive force; yea, it waxeth ſweet.</p>
                  <p>The rottenneſs of the Bone removed, the remaining Ulcer was in a ſhort time filled up with fleſh onely by <hi>Common Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> applied with the <hi>White of an Egg;</hi> and <hi>Skin</hi> was induced by dry Lint onely, that continually imbibed the <hi>Pus,</hi> which (left in the Ulcer) did not a little hinder the generation of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>There are many that ſuppoſe, that Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Veins partly cut off can never be regenerated, becauſe they are Spermatick parts, (ſo by them vulgarly called) but they are deceived. Why may not the Bloud, iſſuing from a ſmall Artery cut off, thruſt to the ſides certain Particles ſtringy and leſs apt for motion (infolding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves each within the other) there form the rudiment of ſome <hi>Tunick,</hi> which may deſerve the name of a ſmall Artery? and why may not the ſame Bloud in its courſe, impeded by ſomewhat offending, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected, and ſo the ſtringy Particles being again caſt to the ſides, there produce the rudiments of ſome Vien? no otherwiſe than as may be ſeen in an Egg (after Incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation for ſome days) in which both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and Veins after the ſame manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59518:40"/>from the liquid matter of the ſame Egg? This caſe is indeed very eaſie to be underſtood.</p>
                  <p>Yea, a very light contact of that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fleſh, with which the Ulcer is filled, preſently cauſeth Bloud to iſſue out, which certainly could not be, were not the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Veins ſo far prolonged.</p>
                  <p>But if there be yet found any one that ſhall be ſo incredulous as not to belive what I have written, him I refer to the <hi>Medico-Phyſical Collections</hi> of the induſtrious <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kart,</hi> wherein he declares, that either him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or ſome other man, in Ulcers firſt hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and afterward filled up with new fleſh, hath (by a <hi>Microſcope</hi>) diſcovered Veins and Arteries; yea, by his Eyes onely, without a <hi>Mycroſcope,</hi> if the part healed was firſt ſucked for a little time.</p>
                  <p>Thus far proceeding, I have now (as I judge) ſo clearly explained the <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> occurrent in this little Maid, that her Caſe may by all be underſtood; having acted far otherwiſe than the anxious Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of old Authors were wont to do. For ſhould I ask them, Whence that Tumor of the Shoulder (of which I ſpake even now) derived its original in the ſick Maid? They would preſently anſwer, Nature had diſcharged her ſelf in that place. But I judge this equally as abſurd as if I ſhould ask why Beer newly boiled
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59518:40"/>caſts up its Dreg through the Bung of the Cask? and another ſhould anſwer. The nature of the Beer, in that place, and by that means, frees it ſelf from its burthen; whereas it ſhould rather be ſaid, the Beer forments; that is, there is a certain inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine motion in the ſmall Particles of the Beer, and by them the ſtringy and other Particles, not ſufficiently apt for like mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are thruſt out by the Bung, where they are not compelled to a motion ſo ſwift.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, ſhould I ask them why that Tumor rather expoſed it ſelf to ſight in the Shoulder than elſewhere? they would rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily thus anſwer: This hapned by reaſon of the debility of the <hi>expulſive</hi> Faculty in the Shoulder. An excellent way of reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning indeed! containing as many <hi>Chimaera's</hi> as words.</p>
                  <p>If any one from a large Veſſel pour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Liquor, with a ſmall and equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Ray, through a ſmall Tunnel into a narrow-mouth'd Bottle, and ſee the Liquor to paſs out with the ſame celerity as it was poured into the Tunnel, but afterwards obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves the liquor in the Tunnel to be more and more accumulated, doth he not egregiouſly expoſe himſelf to the deriſion of every man; if he produce as a cauſe of this the debility of the Expulſive Faculty in the Tunnel; whereas the cauſe is ſome obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (in the inferiour ſmall Pipe of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59518:41"/>Tunnel, or in the narrow Neck of the Bottle) induced by ſome more groſs body by chance contained in the Liquor? Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall diligently weigh all theſe things in his mind, will find the matter to hold parallel in either caſe, and diſcern the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of either ſide alleadged to be equally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>Before I put an end to this <hi>Obſervation,</hi> there remains yet one Problem to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed by me, and it is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether an Ulcer or hollow wound may not be filled up with ſome other Fleſh, whether that Fleſh be taken from ſome other part of the ſame man, or elſe from another <hi>man,</hi> or from ſome Beaſt? eſpecially ſeeing we often find that the Spurs which Cocks uſe in fighting one with the other, cut from their Legs are not onely agglutinated to the head, but alſo largely increaſe in a ſhort time; as we daily ſee the like when Cocks are caſtrated; yea, almoſt every man hath (at ſome time or other) ſeen how a Branch cut from one Tree, doth grow together and unite with another.</p>
                  <p>But the reaſon here is far unlike; for the paſſages (or Pores) exiſting in the Spurs of Cocks, and Branches of Trees, are conſtant, ſo that the Section of them diſtorts them not; wherefore the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Liquors through them is eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, although inſerted into another
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59518:41"/>part or another Body. In our fleſh it is otherwiſe, the ſmall paſſages there are very tender, ſo that by Section or any other force, they are preſently diſtorted, and their ſides (by this means) do almoſt cloſe together, and ſo at that time the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of Humours through the ſame is wholly impeded.</p>

                     <p>Of a Fracture of the Shin-bone.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Man Thirty years of Age leaping out of a Coach, ſuffered an oblique Fracture almoſt in the middle of his <hi>Shin-Bone,</hi> which was attended with inequality of the Leg, grating of the Bone, dolour and imbecility of morion.</p>
                  <p>For one extremity of the Shin-bone, by reaſon of the Fracture, tended this way, the other that way, (whence was the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of the Leg) and when thoſe two extremities hit upon each other, the grating of the Bone was heard; and when they with their ſharpneſs preſſed the <hi>Perioſteum</hi> and adjoyning parts, the firſt cauſe of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour diſcovered it ſelf; but the ſecond cauſe,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59518:42"/>when the extremities of the broken Bone, by their preſſure, compelled die Humours in the ſmall paſſages of the bordering parts, to ſtagnize, wax acid, and irritate the ſmall Fibres.</p>
                  <p>But when the Fibrils were thus diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the points of the Bones and acid Humours, the Animal Spirits could not be determinated rather into this than into that Muſcle, but without diſtinction, ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into all diſturbed parts; and if (though but in a ſmall quantity) they approached nigh to certain Muſcles, they could not enter and flow in, by reaſon of the paſſages of thoſe Muſcles obſtructed by the ſtagni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Humours. And although ſome Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits had flowed into the ſame Muſcles, yet all their tendency was was to move one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the cutting broken Bone to this party, the other to another; whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded nothing but <hi>Vellication, Preſſure,</hi> and <hi>Renovation</hi> of the dolour. Hence the <hi>cauſe</hi> of the imbicility of motion is ſufficiently manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>I, being called preſently, ſet the <hi>Broken Bones,</hi> and then my principal end was to reſtore the circulation of the <hi>Bloud and Humours;</hi> for without doubt the Bloud was here and there ſtagnized. Therefore, to temperate the peccant Acidity, I waſhed the affected part with <hi>Sprit of Wine,</hi> in which a little <hi>Gum Ammoniac</hi> was diſſolved;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59518:42"/>and for the ſame end I applied a Plaiſter compoſed of <hi>Diapalma, Bolus, Spirit of Wine,</hi> and <hi>Oyl of Camomil:</hi> Then for retaining the Bones ſo lately ſet, I uſed <hi>Ligatures</hi> and other things fit, renewing theſe by certain intervals; and ſo the Patient in ſix weeks time could again walk.</p>
                  <p>I am not willing in this place to ſay, that a Fracture made tranſverſe may more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be retained than an oblique Fracture; nor that it is for the moſt part accounted a good ſign of reſtriction, if the great Toe of the Foot directly reſpect the Knee, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things are well known. Nor ſhall I endeavour to render a reaſon why the dolour is mitigated after the Bone is let; becauſe it is known that this is effected by removal of the firſt cauſe of the Dolour of which I ſo lately ſpake. But, before I conclude, I purpoſe to ſhew how the <hi>Callus</hi> is induced which conglutinates the fractu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Bones.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Circulation</hi> of the Bloud and Humours is again reſtored, as well in the fractured Bone as elſewhere, then certain Particles, iſſuing from the Pores of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, paſs through the ſmall paſſages of the Bone; and when they come to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity thereof, they can proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a right Line, becauſe the paſſages were interrupted by the Fracture; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they turn to the ſides, where (adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59518:43"/>to die Bone, and each to other) they conſtitute a <hi>Callus,</hi> which again conjoyns the Bones.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Callus</hi> in the aged and weak is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultly generated, by reaſon of the groſs and viſcous Bloud, which cannot paſs through the ſtreight paſſages of the Bones. Therefore, in ſuch a caſe, the more groſs Particles of the Bloud muſt be attenuated by <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. of the Stone <hi>Oſteocolla</hi> daily taken. Yea, it will not be injurious, if powder of the ſame ſtone be mixed with the Plaiſter that is externally applied.</p>
                  <p>But in our Patient the matter was far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: For the <hi>Callus</hi> extended it ſelf to a very unſeemly bulk; wherefore I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a Plaiſter of <hi>Frogs</hi> with <hi>Mercury,</hi> to the end that this Plaiſter ſhould ſo attenuate certain Particles of the <hi>Callus,</hi> that they might fly away; and alſo a good <hi>Ligature,</hi> that it might ſo compreſs the <hi>Callus,</hi> as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothing new might have acceſs thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
                  <p>Thus I put an end to this <hi>Obſervation,</hi> after I ſhall have told you, that I comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Sick-man's Leg always to lie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and took care that the Sole of the Foot might reſt upon a ſmall Pillow, in the middle of which was an hole. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe (as experience teſtifies) a <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene</hi> might have invaded the bottom of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59518:43"/>the Foot, becauſe the Veſſels and ſmall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the parts are vehemently compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by long lying.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome who in a Fracture of the <hi>Tibia</hi> (as this was) commend viſcous things, which I reject as noxious; becauſe in a body without exerciſe <hi>Obſtructions</hi> do not a little augment, which (on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) ſhould rather be diminiſhed.</p>

                     <p>Of a Diſlocation of the Shoulder.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Man Thirty two years of Age, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from a Coach, ſuffered a Diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in his left Shoulder, ſo that the head of the Bone, fallen into the inferiour part, was the cauſe of a certain eminency there; whilſt, on the contrary, in the ſuperiour part, was diſcerned an unuſual Cavity. The Patient complained of very great pain, and could not move his hand by the anteriour part to his Forehead, nor by the poſteriour to his Neck.</p>
                  <p>For the Bone, fallen from its ſeat, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the <hi>Perioſteum</hi> and adjoyning parts, whence aroſe pain, which was augmented,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59518:44"/>becauſe in the ſmall paſſages of the parts, compreſſed and diſtorted, the Humours ſtagnized, waxed acid, and ſhook the ſmall Fibres.</p>
                  <p>He could not move his Arm as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the head of the Bone, thruſt from its former Cavity, no longer (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) enjoyed an hollow and ſlippery place, requiſite for its motion; alſo hence was the occaſion that the Animal Spirits could not enter (through the ſmall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages obſtructed by the ſtagnizing Humours, and compreſſed by the diſlocated Bone) into the Muſcles and excite them; hence it happened that no motion could be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the head of the Bone did more and more compreſs the parts adjoyning; whence aroſe a new excitation of dolour, which alſo induced no ſmall impediment to the due performance of motion.</p>
                  <p>I, being called to the Sick, repoſited the diſlocated Bone, and then the motion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently returned; there was indeed ſome dolour preſent, becauſe the acid Humours ſtagnizing did (as yet) in ſome meaſure irritate the Fibrils; nevertheleſs the pain was very much diminiſhed, becauſe the head of the Bone, now contained in its proper Cavity, did no longer preſs upon the ſenſible parts.</p>
                  <p>The Bone being ſet, I endeavoured (by things temperating Acidity) to diſſolve the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59518:44"/>ſtagnizing Humours, and reſtore to them their due Circulation; wherefore I waſhed the affected part with <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> in which <hi>Gum Ammoniac</hi> was diſſolved; and applied a Plaiſter, (compoſed of <hi>Spirit of Wine, Bolus, Diapalma,</hi> and <hi>Oyl of Camomil</hi>) and then put Lint wrapt up like a Ball, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Arm-pit; and by this means the Patient was healed in a ſhort ſpace of time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter Pigraeus</hi> a French Author, and <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon</hi> worthy of praiſe, commends <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringents</hi> to a Bone lately repoſited; but (be it ſpoken with the leave of ſo famous a man) in this he is egregiouſly deceived: For <hi>Aſtringents</hi> augment <hi>Obſtructions,</hi> which ſhould rather be diminiſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paulus Berbette</hi> wills, that the influx of Humours (in this caſe) be prohibited, but improperly; becauſe that influx being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, ſhould not be ſtopped. That man undoubtedly ſaw in 2 <hi>Dislocations,</hi> the near adjoyning parts often elevated into a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. Alſo he obſerved by frequent expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that <hi>Frankincenſe, Maſtich, Bolus,</hi> and the like, removed this Tumour: But when he judged this Tumour to be produced from an influx more copious than uſual; and when, according to this ſtated opinion, he thought his Medicaments did therefore help, becauſe they prohibited that Influx, then (I ſay) he erred. For Obſtructions
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59518:45"/>were the cauſe that the Humours were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acervated and elevated into a Tumour, and ſo waxed acid; and the ſaid Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments onely profit, becauſe they remove the Obſtructions, and temperate the Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>Having now ſpoken of the <hi>Diſlocation</hi> of the Shoulder ſuddenly happening; there is yet another Diſlocation ſlowly invading, and more ſlowly ſanable, <hi>viz.</hi> when by External force the <hi>Ligaments</hi> of the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der are contuſed, ſo that the ſmall paſſages are diſtorted, whence the Humours (cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating through the <hi>Ligaments</hi>) do there ſubſiſt, and in proceſs of time inſinuate themſelves into the Pores of the Fibrils (of which the <hi>Ligaments</hi> conſiſts) and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thoſe Pores, not according to the breadth, but according to the length of the <hi>Ligaments.</hi> For the <hi>Ligaments,</hi> when motion is, are often extended in length: even ſo, the <hi>Ligaments,</hi> which otherwiſe were wont to contain the head of the Bone in its Cavity, are now ſo far prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that the Bone falls out of its proper ſeat.</p>
                  <p>This Diſlocation is eaſily reſtored, but the Bone repoſited is very difficultly retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in its place.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>A Young Man aged Twenty years, exerciſed in Chyrurgery, with the Puncture of a Lancet hurt the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Finger of his left Hand, about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Article; whence aroſe pain at firſt not very great, but by the next morning it was vaſtly augmented; and beſides redneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the whole Finger, attended with burning heat and ſwelling, and the <hi>Cutis</hi> (in places nigh the Wound) was ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, pallid, and inſenſible.</p>
                  <p>After I had accurately conſidered the <hi>Phaenomena's,</hi> I concluded the Nerve to be hurt by the Razor, whence at firſt aroſe but ſmall pain.</p>
                  <p>But by reaſon of the ſmall paſſages bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering on the wounded Nerve, Humours (interrupted by that ſmall Wound) other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe freely circulating, were conſtrained to ſubſiſt about the Wound, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59518:46"/>acid, and ſo by the Humours follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them were driven to the wounded Nerve, where (permixt with the Animal Spirits haſtning through the Nerve) they excited a certain efferveſcency, by reaſon of the Volatile Salt, contained in thoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Spirits; and by this means the acid Particles (conſtituted in motion great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) with the acuteneſs of their ſides, egregiouſly vellicated the Fibrils of the wounded Nerve, and ſo excited that grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous dolour I even now ſpake of.</p>
                  <p>The acid Humours thus forced into an efferveſcency with the Animal Spirits, not onely irritated and diſturbed the Fibrils of the wounded Nerve, but alſo the Fibrils of the adjacent parts (yea of the whole Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) whence many ſmall paſſages were ſo diſtorted, that the Bloud and Humours ſetled in them, and (by a ſhort delay there) aſſumed the nature of Acidity, whence the heat and tumour of the whole Finger, or inflammation of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The ſame acid Particles, exerciſing their Efferveſcency, had wholly cut in ſunder thoſe Fibrils which knit the Skin, ſited round about the Wound, together with the ſubjected part, and ſo the <hi>Cutis</hi> was ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, pallid, and inſenſible; becauſe thoſe (often-cited) acid and cutting Particles had cut in ſunder very many Fibrils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59518:47"/>the ſame <hi>Cutis;</hi> which Fibrils criſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping on heaps produced ſo many and ſo pertinacious Obſtructions, that the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bloud, Humours, and Spirits through the <hi>Cutis</hi> was totally impeded.</p>
                  <p>Things being thus, I judged the Wound ſufficiently dangerous, and therefore the cure thereof to be diligently ſet, about; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving long before ſeen a French Souldier, whoſe Nerve about the Cubit of the Arm was but lightly prickt with a Sword; who after a long ſeries of time, and many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties overcome, was with very great care and pains at laſt reſtored to his priſtine ſtate of health: Yea, I alſo ſaw an Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the Nerve of whoſe Thigh was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a Leaden-bullet ſhot out of a Gun; this man (a Convulſion being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited) died in a ſhort time after the wound was inflicted.</p>
                  <p>I had often before mixed <hi>Oyl of Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> with the acid <hi>Oyl of Vitriol,</hi> and ſaw an Efferveſcenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ave felt ſufficient heat, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Glaſs containing thoſe Liquors: Hence I did without difficulty perceive how powerfully <hi>Oyl of Turpentine</hi> did reſiſt Acidity, and (by conſequence) how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently ſerviceable it would prove in this our caſe; wherefore I poured <hi>Oyl of Turpentine</hi> (before made ſufficiently hot) into the Wound, that ſo the Parades there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59518:47"/>of (put into greater motion) might more eaſily and more profoundly penetrate, and conſequently act more powerfully in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating the peccant Acidity. Then I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Paracelſus</hi> his <hi>Stiptick Plaiſter,</hi> which alſo temperates Acidity. Afterward on the <hi>Finger,</hi> and indeed all over the <hi>Hand,</hi> I laid a doubled Cloath moiſtned with a Lavament conſiſting of <hi>Spirit of Wine, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Elder, Camphire,</hi> and <hi>Salt-prunella;</hi> changing theſe twice a day, and with an Inſtrument removing the <hi>Cutis,</hi> already ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the ſubjacent fleſh: Thus our Young man was cured in a ſhort time.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while it is worthy obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I ſaw a neceſſity of being indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly careful to prevent the acceſs of the ambient Air; becauſe that contains in it ſelf Acidity, which is apparent thus, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it coagulates <hi>Milk;</hi> yea <hi>Bloud</hi> it ſelf when extravaſate, is in a ſhort time coagulated by the Air; whereas the ſame is found to perſiſt in its wonted Fluidneſs for ſeveral days, if it remain in the Veſſels of any Carkaſs where it is free from the ambient Air.</p>
                  <p>By the aforeſaid it is ſufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, why there is much leſs dolour in a Nerve wholly cut off than in that which is onely prickt, or but lightly wounded: for when a Nerve is totally cut in ſunder, one Extreamity is retracted to this part, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59518:48"/>to another, and is abſconded by the fleſh, ſo that the acid Humour (inherent in the Wound) and the ambient Air, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have acceſs to the Nerve.</p>
                  <p>The famous <hi>Sylvius</hi> deduceth extream dolour, and other <hi>Phaenomena's</hi> occurring in a Wound of the Nerve, from a far other cauſe than I do. For he thinks ſome of the Fibrils in the Nerve being cut, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as yet intire) ſuffer ſo much the more by a continued ſtretching produced by the Animal Spirits; and that hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth <hi>Dolour,</hi> Convulſion, and other Evils frequently obſerved in ſuch caſes: But (with the leave of ſo great a man) this Cauſe pleaſeth me not, ſeeing from it I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conclude that the pallid and inſenſible <hi>Cutis</hi> is frequently ſeparated from the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent part. This Cauſe of his is repugnant to Experience, which teacheth that the Puncture of a Nerve is more dangerous than if the Nerve were cut to the midſt: For in a Nerve cut to the midſt many more Fibrils are cut, than in a Nerve prickt, in which often but a few Fibrils onely are hurt. But it is certain that <hi>Sylvius</hi> did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf believe his own reaſon not ſufficient, ſeeing in the ſame Twenty third Chapter of his Second Book he ſaith, that <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menons</hi> exhibiting themſelves in the Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of a Nerve, ſeem to him more like a Dream, than to any obſervation made by the Senſes.</p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:59518:48"/>
                  <p>Therefore, that I may put an end to this <hi>Obſervation,</hi> I ſay, that in the wound of a Nerve Acidity is peccant, and that ſuch Medicaments ſhould be applied as infringe Acidity: For this Cauſe is commended <hi>Oyl of Wax,</hi> and <hi>Ear-wax;</hi> but acid things are not fit here to be uſed, which was well obſerved by <hi>Felix Plaiterus,</hi> who (in his Book of Obſervations, page 468) ſaith, Acidity is very inimical to the Nerves.</p>

                     <p>Of Dolour of the Head.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Man Forty two years of Age was vexed with a moſt vehement dolour of his Head, and indeed that only about the Temple of one ſide, where it remained fixed; which <hi>Affect</hi> if any one will for this cauſe inſignize with the name of a <hi>Clavus,</hi> let him for me.</p>
                  <p>I judged the cauſe of this Dolour to be an Acido-corroſive Humor, there lying hid and ſtagnizing by reaſon of Obſtruction very pertinaceous.</p>
                  <p>There was one (ſtudious of Medicine) preſent, who perſwaded himſelf that the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59518:49"/>cure of this Affect would be beſt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by <hi>Sudorificks;</hi> which, by reaſon of the pertinacy of the Obſtruction in this Diſeaſe, I judged equally as impoſſible as in the <hi>Panaritium,</hi> which I never heard to have been healed by <hi>Sudorificks,</hi> though the ſame Affect derives its original from an Acido-corroſive Humor: for it is but a very ſmall portion of the <hi>Sudorifick</hi> that can ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to the pained part.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I rather applied to the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted part <hi>Powder of Cantharides</hi> (with his own Spittle formed into a <hi>Veſicatory</hi>) about the evening, and left it on all night.</p>
                  <p>The famous <hi>Sylvius</hi> to <hi>Cantharides</hi> addeth <hi>Vinegar,</hi> thinking there would thence ariſe a certain Fermentation, and ſo the <hi>Veſicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> operate the better. Yea the moſt Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Willis</hi> alſo adjoyns acid things to many forms of <hi>Veſicatories;</hi> which I my ſelf have often imitated, but as often obſerved, that after the ſpace of a whole day no Bliſters have been raiſed by the <hi>Cantharides,</hi> when I mixed them with Vinegar, <hi>viz.</hi> for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe the Volatile Salt of die <hi>Canthari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> was enervated by the Vinegar, in which Salt the principal Virtue of them conſiſts.</p>
                  <p>Coming the next day, I beheld a large Bliſter raiſed by the <hi>Cantharides,</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that the ſick-man was wholly eaſed of his pain.</p>
                  <p>But I could not perſwade my ſelf that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59518:49"/>this dolour was removed by the Bliſter rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and by reaſon of the Water flowing from the ſame when opened. For the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that iſſued out, was neither ſharp of taſte, nor could be ſuch; becauſe had it been ſo, it muſt needs have inferred ſome dolour on the ſubjected skin before apertion of the Bliſter, which notwithſtanding it did not, although the <hi>Cutis</hi> (the <hi>Epider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> being by this means removed) be of it ſelf ſufficiently ſenſible, as is apparent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is often hurt, and feels pain, by the ambient Air.</p>
                  <p>What was it then that removed that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour? The Volatile Salt of the <hi>Canthari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> which (by the Vapours paſſing out through the skin) ſtirred up to a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſwift motion, penetrated to the Acido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corroſive humor, and temperated and cut the ſame, and took away the obſtruction.</p>
                  <p>But whence then did the Bliſter derive its original? I ſay, that in the mean time, when the more volatile Particles of the <hi>Cantharides</hi> had penetrated far enough for correcting the peccant Humor, other more groſe and more acid Particles ſubſiſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Cutis,</hi> in which they brake cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Fibrils, which (criſping up together) did ſo obſtruct the ſmall paſſages, that the Humors in circulation were partly impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſo gathered together in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the <hi>Cutis,</hi> and elevated the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59518:50"/>Cuticle into the form of a Bliſter; which might eaſily happen, becauſe the Fibrils which joyn die <hi>Cutis</hi> with the Cuticle were now broken in ſunder by the aforeſaid more groſs and more acid Particles of the <hi>Cantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome one may perhaps here ſay, that that Water ſhould not have been there congregated, but rather have paſſed out by the Pores of the Cuticle, by which we ſo often ſee Sweats to iſſue out. To him I anſwer, the moſt groſs Parts of the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharides</hi> remained and adhered about the Cuticle, and very much conſtringed the Pores thereof; which ſhould ſeem ſtrange to no man, who (even but once in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time) hath ſeen how eaſily by heat of fire Parchments may be crumpled up, and that the common Fire which ſo crumples them, doth alſo ſometimes excite ſmall Bliſters, wholly like thoſe that are raiſed by <hi>Cantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides;</hi> but becauſe the Pores of the Cuticle were ſo cloſed, therefore the Vapours (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe freely exhaling) were accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and augmented the abundance of Humor contained in the Bliſter.</p>
                  <p>If any man, not as yet plainly convinced by our way of reaſoning, believes that the long lying on of the <hi>Cantharides</hi> (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Bliſters raiſed) helps until his mind be altered by the Authority of ſome approved Writer, I would have him go
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59518:50"/>to <hi>Lazarus Riverius,</hi> who (in his <hi>Third Century, Obſervation</hi> 4.) declares, that a <hi>Veſicatory</hi> left on but a quarter of an hour, had in that time wholly removed the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of a Bees ſting, no Bliſters being raiſed by reaſon of ſo ſhort delay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Francis Redi,</hi> in a Treatiſe of Inſects, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that he had ſeen a white ſhining Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor (undoubtedly Acido-corroſive) flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from the Stings of Scorpions; and it is very probable, that ſuch an humor (in the Punctures of Bees) doth in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner flow from their Stings, which is the cauſe of dolour. Hence it is now mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that the dolour, of which <hi>Riverius</hi> ſpeaks, vaniſhed, becauſe the acid Humor which flowed out from the Bees Sting and excited dolour, was temperated by the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt of the <hi>Cantharides.</hi>

                     <p>Of the Contracture of a Tendon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Fracture of the Shoulder-Bone.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Young man, aged Twenty two years, after a Fracture of the Shoulder-bone healed, could not extend his inbowed and rigid Arm.</p>
                  <p>The more remote cauſe of this Evil was the Surgeon's negligence, who left the Arm inbowed for five or ſix Weeks; whereas he ſhould, as often as, and every time he bound up the Fracture, have frequently extended the ſame, as a thing of ſpecial note in <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgick Practice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is not therefore a wonder, ſeeing we daily ſee a Bow which hath for ſome tine remained unbowed, not to be eaſily bowed again: Yea, who doth not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times experience in himſelf, how difficultly he is able to go and extend his feet, after he hath ſate unmoved in a Coach but for one onely day.</p>
                  <p>But foraſmuch as this Compariſon doth
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59518:51"/>not as yet ſufficiently illuſtrate the matter, my purpoſe is ſomewhat more narrowly to ſearch out the cauſe of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>When the Arm was inbowed about the Cubit, the Tendon of the two-headed Muſcle, bowing the Cubit, was contracted (but what is here ſpoken of the Tendon of the two-headed Muſcle, may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of other Tendons of Muſcles bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cubit) and ſo the Pores of the Fibrils, of which the Tendon conſiſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore round, are changed into oval, ſo that the greater Diameter of the Pores hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Latitude of the Fibrils.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while the Humors paſſed out from the Pores of the Arteries, which (by reaſon of motion often inſtituted) freely perfected their circulation, now (by reaſon of reſt) did in ſome ſort ſubſiſt in the Tendon. Yea, in a ſhort ſpace of time, certain groſs Particles of thoſe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, deeply inſinuated themſelves into thoſe Oval Pores of the Fibrils, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and confirmed them in that oblong Figure; and in proceſs of time thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Particles ſo pertinaceouſly adhered in the above-named Pores, that they could not by any means be expelled thence: Henee the Tendon of the two-headed Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcle was made ſhorter; no otherwiſe than as we ſee new Ropes, or new Cloath, ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled with Water to ſhrink.</p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:59518:52"/>
                  <p>Hence alſo the ſaid Tendon appeared hard and rigid; whence it is (as I judge) ſufficiently manifeſt why the Arm could not be extended: for the Muſcles, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Arm, could not perform their wonted action, being before contracted; theſe could not be contracted, but the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don with its two-headed Muſcle muſt needs begin to ceaſe acting. This was impoſſible, by reaſon of the Pores of the Fibrils (ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the aforeſaid Particles) by which the Tendon was tumified.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe of this <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> by this means found out, the method of curing was without difficulty underſtood, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was behooful to expel the Particles ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the Pores; wherefore I uſed a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of Wine, in which were boiled Herbs, and other things abounding with much Volatile Salt; and then I applied a Plaiſter of Frogs with <hi>Mercury,</hi> and (after I had continued that for ſeveral days) I often commanded the Patient to hold ſome <hi>weight</hi> in his hand, that ſo the Particles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in the obſtructed Pores, and by the aforeſaid Medicaments in ſome meaſure macerated (in the Dutch <hi>Idiom <hi>los gewyckt</hi>

                     <p>Of a Vein Cut.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Man, aged Thirty ſix years, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Vein to be cut in the Flex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of his Arm; the next day ſeveral Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Limpid Humor flowed out from the Orifice of the Vein cut, and that Efflux continued for ſeveral days after; but the Arm in the mean while was neither affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with dolour nor with redneſs. A rare <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> indeed! which I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ever to have hapned in all my Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps ſome ſmall Lymphatick-Veſſel lay above the Vein to be cut, which in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Vein was wounded, and (by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Particles ſtagnizing and waxing acid nigh the Orifice of the ſmall wound made) irritated and continually gently convulſed, ſent forth this abundance of Lympid Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity. I temperated the peccant Acidity nigh the Lymphatick-Veſſel with <hi>Oyl of Turpentine</hi> poured in hot; and ſo compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Aperture to cloſe, and the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Humor (in a ſhort time) to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59518:53"/>or rather again to circulate by a natural way.</p>
                  <p>I likewiſe knew a certain <hi>Tyro</hi> in <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgy,</hi> who in Section of the Median-Vein, wounded a ſubjected Tendon, whence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe dolour and redneſs, which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, at length was inferred ſo great a Contracture of the Tendon of the two-headed Muſcle, that the Arm having now for a long time been inbowed, could not be extended by the Patient, whoſe Cure was effected even after the ſame manner as I ſhewed in the foregoing <hi>Obſervation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is to ſay, ſome Humors ſtagnizing about the wounded Tendon, waxed acid, and (irritating that Tendon) cauſed the Animal Spirits to flow in greater abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance than uſual; by which means the Tendon (with the Muſcle annexed) was contracted, and the Arm incurvated, which afterward remained ſo inbowed, by reaſon of certain Particles which obſtructed the Pores of the Fibrils in the Tendon, after the ſame manner as I (in the precedent <hi>Obſervation</hi>) have largely explained.</p>
                  <p>But dolour and redneſs, which often at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Puncture of a Tendon, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſame Cauſe, and require the ſame Cure that I propoſed in the Puncture of a Nerve.</p>
                  <p>Many Chyrurgeons, when they would evacuate groſs Bloud, make a large Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59518:53"/>of the Vein; and when they purpoſe to let out Bloud more ſubtile, a leſſer Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; but evily. For if the groſs Particles of the Bloud (mixt with the more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile) can accurately enough circulate through the Arteries and Capillary Veins, is it not more clear than the Sun that no Orifice (in the cutting of a Vein) can be made ſo very ſmall, but that with the more ſubtile part of the Bloud, that which is more groſs may be exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lled by the ſame. Which the moſt acute <hi>Bayle</hi> (perhaps <hi>Boyl</hi>) did well obſerve.</p>
                  <p>The famous Mr. <hi>Leeuwenhoeck,</hi> by a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcope,</hi> diſcovered Humane Bloud to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of ſmall red Globes floating in a Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline Humor; which, when the Bloud (after cutting of a Vein) received in a Porringer, was coagulated, their motion being loſt, deſcended to the bottom, the Chryſtalline Humor (through which they were before moved) floating above.</p>
                  <p>Certainly a ſtrange and pleaſant Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but of no uſe in the <hi>Medicinal Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</hi> For they, who (from this ground) endeavour to deduce the Cauſes and Cures of <hi>Fevers,</hi> and other Diſeaſes, ſeem to me to trifle out the time, and loſe all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; whereas rather, had they reſpect to Acidity, Salt, Bitterneſs, Sweetneſs, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther properties (undoubtedly contained in the Bloud) they would certainly thence
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59518:54"/>reap far greater underſtanding in cure of the ſick.</p>
                  <p>Many Authors preſcribe the opening of the <hi>Cephalic-Vein,</hi> rather than of the <hi>Median</hi> or <hi>Baſilic;</hi> but unadviſedly. For I have often found by experience, that that Vein eaſily recedes from its proper place, and ſo when it is cutting ſhuns the wound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                  <p>I have often obſerved in fat Boys a Vein (preſently after the uſual Ligature) to be ſufficiently tumid and manifeſt; but if not quickly opened hath ſoon diſappeared, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Bloud preſſed downwards the ſubjected and readily-yielding Fatneſs, that ſo (notwithſtanding the Ligature) it might again freely paſs through the Vein.</p>
                  <p>After the cutting of a Vein, when the Vein ſeemed ſufficiently cloſed, I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten beheld the Bloud iſſuing out thence with great violence; and indeed from no other cauſe, than that the <hi>Chyrurgeons</hi> firſt applied their Ligature and Lint compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and afterward inbowed the Arm: For by this means, the Lips of the Orifice, which before (in the extenſion of the Arm) were conjoyned, again ſeparated each from other when the Arm was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowed.</p>
                  <p>Oftentimes a certain Lividneſs is found left after the cutting of a Vein, the cauſe of which is too frequently the evil uſe of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59518:54"/>Vinegar, in which is imbibed the Lint com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing, which is put upon the Aperture of the Vein; whereas it is indeed ſufficiently manifeſt, that the Bloud is coagulated by Acidity, and acquires a Livid and black colour.</p>
                  <p>Before I put an end to this <hi>Obſervation,</hi> I think fit to add the counſel of <hi>Peter Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graeus,</hi> that we may thence (if poſſible) reap ſome further benefit.</p>
                  <p>That very famous and moſt dexterous Chyrurgeon commands, that after the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a Vein, the Aperture ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with Oyl, if it be intended again to extract Bloud the ſame day from the ſame Orifice without a new made Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>But if Oyl can, though for a ſhort time applied, hinder the cloſure of the Orifice of a Vein cut, how evilly do they act, who uſe Oyl in the cure of Wounds; and for no other reaſon, than becauſe they have ſeen the ſame thing done by their Maſters? As for Example: <hi>Oyl of Saint-Johns-Wort:</hi> For if <hi>Saint-Johns-Wort</hi> profits Wounds, by reaſon of its Volatile Salt temperating A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity, why do they not rather extract the <hi>Tincture of Saint-Johns-Wort</hi> by <hi>Spirit of Wine?</hi> into which it much more eaſily and more copiouſly transfers its Volatile Salt, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Oyl, which hurts Wounds; becauſe that obſtructing the Pores and Paſſages, ſtops
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59518:55"/>the Circulation of the Bloud and Humors; whereas that Circulation ſhould rather be excited, to which excitation <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> is not a little available. For it egregiouſly temperates Acidity, which uſually coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the Bloud and Humors in Wounds, and renders them unfit for Circulation. But leaſt I ſhould be found too prolix in this matter, I here put an end to this <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                     <p>Of the Cracking of a Tendon.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Woman, aged Forty three years, after greater Labour than uſual, in her right Hand ſuffered an impotency to motion, with Tumor and Dolour; and when the Tendon, ſited in the Hand, was preſſed with the Finger, it gave a ſound.</p>
                  <p>This is an Affect, which often occurs in the Practice of Chyrurgy, though it hath hitherto been treated of by no man, (that I have heard of) therefore I ſhall call it <hi>Crepitus Tendinis,</hi> or the Cracking of a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
                  <p>By this Woman's unaccuſtomed Labour,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59518:55"/>the Fibrils of the Tendon were ſo diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Humors (impeded in their Circulation) there ſubſiſted and were coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated; whence the Impotency of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Tumor, Dolour, and Cracking of the Tendon, were moſt readily induced.</p>
                  <p>I feared, that the Humors ſtagnizing in the Tendon, would be daily more and more coagulated, and thence that Tumor take beginning, which is known to many by the name of a <hi>Ganglion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, I ſuſpected that certain Particles of the ſubſiſting Humors would be received within the Pores of the Fibrils, compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Tendon, and obſtruct them ſo, as (in the Third <hi>Obſervation</hi> of this <hi>Decade</hi>) we ſhewed to be apt to render them too propenſe to induce both <hi>Contracture</hi> and rigidneſs of the Tendon.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, judging it high time to ſet about the Cure, I ordered <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> to be enkindled in ſuch wiſe, that the Vapour ariſing thence might ſurround the hand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; and this being done, commanded a Plaiſter of <hi>Frogs,</hi> with <hi>Mercury,</hi> to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. By this means the coagulated Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors were diſſolved, the Obſtructions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the Patient (in a few days) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to her priſtine ſtate of health.</p>

                     <p>Of an Haemorrhagia, from a Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer of the Tibia.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the right <hi>Tibia</hi> of a Woman aged For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, from an Internal cauſe, an Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer was formed upon a ſufficiently large <hi>Varix,</hi> which yielded to no Remedies. This Evil was alſo attended with a Tumor, and a large <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> very troubleſome, which in like manner could not be removed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Medicaments.</p>
                  <p>After a few days the <hi>Varix</hi> was unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly opened (by the Acido-corroſive Humor there inherent) from which iſſued out at leaſt <hi>lib. ij.</hi> of black and (as the ſtanders by affirmed) very ſtinking Bloud.</p>
                  <p>I ordered that <hi>Placentula</hi> (in a form ſomewhat hard) compoſed of Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments temperating Acidity, which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the Sixth <hi>Obſervation</hi> of the Firſt <hi>Decade,</hi> to be applied by the Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, and ſo not onely cloſed up the <hi>Varix,</hi> but alſo temperated that Acidity inherent in the Ulcer, which otherwiſe (by its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſion)
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59518:56"/>would eaſily again have opened the <hi>Varix,</hi> and beſides have much impeded the cure of the Ulcer.</p>
                  <p>It was wonderful to ſee, that after the <hi>Varix</hi> (unexpectedly opened) had caſt out ſo great abundance of Bloud, the <hi>Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipelas</hi> and other Symptomes ſoon vaniſhed, and the Ulcer daily ſhewed it ſelf in a ſtate more and more meliorated; ſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpace of three Weeks (by the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly help of the aforeſaid <hi>Placentula</hi>) it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloſed.</p>
                  <p>I now intend not here to treat of the Original and Cure of the <hi>Varix, Ulcer,</hi> and <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> having accurately enough diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of that in the Sixth <hi>Obſervation</hi> of the Firſt <hi>Decade;</hi> becauſe a diſh of Crambe twice cocted was always deadly to me, if to any other man.</p>
                  <p>But my intention here, is to confirm what I have ſpoken by Experience, and hath been before by me treated of (in the ſaid Sixth <hi>Obſervation</hi> of the Firſt <hi>Decade</hi>) <hi>viz.</hi> to ſhew that undoubtedly the <hi>Eryſipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> and Ulcer derived their Original from Acidity, and likewiſe how opportunely I inſtituted the Section of the <hi>Varix</hi> in that varicous Ulcer of the <hi>Tibia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But from the Example before-alleadged theſe Concluſions may eaſily be drawn: for neither the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> nor the Ulcer would give place to any Remedies, ſo long
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59518:57"/>as that <hi>Varix</hi> was replete with ſo great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of black and (undoubtedly by its long delay) acid Bloud, which no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner iſſued out, but the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> vaniſhed, and the Ulcer cloſed in a ſhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of a vaſt Contuſion of the Arm.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Matron, aged Fifty ſix years, after a Fall from on high, complained of an unaptneſs to motion, and very great dolour of her left Arm, which appeared very much ſwoln, although of the ſame colour with the ſound skin. I perceived by the Pulſe a more than uſual ſwiftneſs of motion in the Bloud, <hi>viz.</hi> by reaſon of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour which the Patient had conceived by the Fall.</p>
                  <p>After we had very acurately inquired into the cauſe of the Evil, we could not (through the whole length of the Arm) find either Fracture or Diſlocation, but a very great <hi>Contuſion</hi> of the whole Arm; ſo that much of the Extravaſate Bloud, and alſo of the Humors (adhering in the ſmall
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59518:57"/>paſſages of the Arm diſtorted by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion</hi>) ſtagnized, and in a ſhort time wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed acid; whence that Imbecility, Tumor, and <hi>Dolour,</hi> may rationally be concluded to have derived their Original.</p>
                  <p>Some, to render the motion of the Bloud more pleaſing, do here preſently cut a Vein; whereas I, on the contrary omitted the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Vein, &amp; gave to the Patient an <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine Tincture</hi> (prepared of <hi>Opium</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things) which much more ſecurely, and with greater Utility diminiſhed the motion of the Bloud.</p>
                  <p>After ſome few hours, I exhibited to the Sick a ſudorifick Powder, which would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo temperate the Acidity of the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate Bloud and ſtagnizing Humors; this I repeated the two following nights with good ſucceſs. This Powder conſiſted of <hi>Diaphoretick Antimony, Crabs-eyes</hi> prepared, <hi>Salt-prunella Antimoniat,</hi> and other things; and hereby the dolour was in no ſmall meaſure remitted, and the Extravaſate Bloud was driven out to the <hi>Cutis,</hi> which then (all over the Arm) from the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Fingers was very livid, yea wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed black.</p>
                  <p>The Chyrurgeons, that were preſent with me, did in the beginning of the Cure (without my conſent) anoint the whole Arm with <hi>Oyl of Roſes,</hi> which hurts not ſo much by reaſon of the <hi>Roſes,</hi> as by reaſon
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59518:58"/>of the <hi>Oyl-Olive.</hi> For although this might do ſome good, yet it could not profit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it could have penetrated to that place, where the Extravaſate Bloud and ſtagnizing Humours lay; but ſo far it could not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate, unleſs in form of Vapour, and the heat of our Bodies is too weak to convert <hi>Oyl-Olive</hi> into ſuch Vapours; ſeeing indeed a ſufficiently ſtrong Fire made of Wood and Coals, is not of force ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Particles of <hi>Oyl-Olive</hi> (put into a Pot) into the form of Vapours.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the <hi>Oyl-Olive</hi> was ſo far from doing good, that (as I judged) it rather did hurt, becauſe by its ſtringy Particles it augmented the Obſtructions, and ſo cauſed the Bloud and Humors yet more to ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize; and beſides (by its cloſing the Pores of the Skin) it hindered the acceſs of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Medicaments to the place affected.</p>
                  <p>If common <hi>Roſes</hi> be cold as many think, I ſhould reject them in this caſe; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe from their bitterneſs and penetrating Odour the contrary may be judged by thoſe who (laying aſide their prejudices) will rather follow Verity than Antiquity. Therefore I in this caſe condemn <hi>Oyl of Roſes,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>Oyl-Olive,</hi> but not by reaſon of ſome Particles of the <hi>Roſes</hi> mixt therewith.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Chyrurgeons applied to the whole Arm (anointed with <hi>Oyl of Roſes</hi>)
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59518:58"/>that <hi>Defenſive Plaiſter,</hi> the deſcription of which is found in the <hi>Ultrajectine Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copoeia;</hi> which indeed I do not here whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reject, becauſe it containeth many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients temperating Acidity; as <hi>Bolus, Terra Sigillata, Lithargyry,</hi> and other things; but to what end ſhould here be added <hi>Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-Berries, Oyl of Myrtles,</hi> and <hi>Auſtere Red-Wine?</hi> Theſe indeed bind up the Pores of the Skin, and ſo wholly impede the pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of other fit Ingredients to the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted part.</p>
                  <p>Experience did in a ſhort time confirm the truth of my Aſſertion, when many Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles (diſperſed through the whole Arm) came in ſight.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I preſcribed the following <hi>Lavament,</hi> which I ſubſtituted inſtead of the Oyl and Plaiſter, as being a Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that would powerfully reſiſt Acidity, and conſequently well diſſolve the coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Bloud and Humors.</p>

                  <p>By this means the Puſtles vaniſhed, the Dolour was diminiſhed, the motion of the Arm gradually returned, and the <hi>Livid</hi> colour was turned yellow.</p>
                  <p>Then (the Chyrurgeons willing the Medicaments ſhould be changed) inſtead of the <hi>Defenſive Plaiſter,</hi> which they again propoſed, I preſcribed a Fumigation tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating Acidity, which conſiſted of <hi>Bay-Berries, Juniper-Berries, Frankincenſe, Maſtich, Myrrh,</hi> and other things. For if theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could help in the aforeſaid Plaiſter, where they lay bound up by the Suet and Wax, they muſt needs be much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, when (in the form of Fume) they could fly up and ſurround the Arm, its ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour part being covered; and ſo, being forcibly enough agitated, could enter the Pores of the Arm, by that time well open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the heat.</p>
                  <p>After this I commanded <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> to be burnt, the Vapour of which aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Arm, and entring through the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59518:59"/>Pores infringed the Acidity, which had in no ſmall meaſure coagulated the Bloud and Humours; and by that means the Patient was healed, the dolour and yellowneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the motion of the Arm reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>I moſt aſſuredly perſwade my ſelf, that the Contuſion would not have been ſo great, if a Fracture of the Bone in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients Arm had alſo been concomitant: For the Bone when broken, recedes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſeth no more; but when the Bone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains entire, and conſequently (by reaſon of its hardneſs) makes ſtrenuous reſiſtance, and when there is (on the other part) a ſolid Body contuſing, then the interſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fleſh is no otherwiſe preſſed on either part, than as if it were put under a Preſs, and ſo it is in a ſtrange manner contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                  <p>And this is no more than what our dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practice confirms; in which I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten obſerved a Contuſion, where the Bone hath been broaken, to be much leſs than where the Bone hath remained unhurt.</p>
                  <p>In this Cure my fear was, that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travaſate Bloud ſhould be ſo much coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, that it could not be afterwards diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and ſo might at length become ſo very acid and corroſive, as to infect the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent parts with a Gangrene. For it was not long before that I was called to a
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59518:60"/>young Man, who had for eight days neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected a Contuſion of the <hi>Tibia;</hi> after that I was called, and (ſeeing how it was) compelled to open the contuſed part with a Lancet, I perceived many ſufficiently large Clots of Bloud, firmly coagulated, black and putrid, which had (in ſome ſort) infected the Cavity in which they were conteined, with a Gangrene; which notwithſtanding I in a ſhort time removed by waſhing it with <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and by inſperſing the Pouders of <hi>Myrrh</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes.</hi>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59518:60"/>the Hand, the ſmall paſſages of which were (by that unuſual labour) ſo diſtorted, that the Humors in their circulation meeting with many Obſtructions, ſtagnized in thoſe paſſages of the Tendon, and then (by the Humors following them) were forced up to that Membrane, which inveſts the Tendon; where, having formed a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity for themſelves, they were collected, and the more viſcous Particles were (in ſome ſort) concreted, the more thin Particles in the mean while paſſing out. Hence the Tumor (of which I here treat, and is by many diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the Name of a <hi>Ganglion</hi>) deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved its original.</p>
                  <p>I, with my Thumb, ſtrongly compreſſed this Tumor, and ſaw it, by this means, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to vaniſh, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Humors (conſtituting the Tumour) were again thruſt out on every ſide through thoſe ſmall paſſages of the Tendon. But becauſe the Obſtructions could not be ſo removed, I feared their return: therefore (for attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the Viſcous Humors, and removing the remaining Obſtructions) I applied a Plaiſter of <hi>Frogs</hi> with <hi>Mercury,</hi> and upon that a ſufficiently ſtrait Ligature, which prevented the Viſcous Humors, from gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again (as before) in the aforeſaid Cavity.</p>
                  <p>But when this Tumor had continued for ſome years, then it could not be removed by preſſure of the Thumb; but I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreined
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59518:61"/>to uſe a Wooden <hi>Ferula,</hi> not differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that which School-maſters uſe in chaſtizing Boys, (onely that in the midſt thereof a certain portion of Lead lay infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) and with one onely ſtroak of ſuch a <hi>Ferula</hi> (the Patients Face being turned backwards from his affected hand) I ſaw the <hi>Ganglion</hi> wholly to vaniſh, which had full three years vexed the Patient, whoſe Cure was then compleated in a ſhort time after, by the aforeſaid Plaiſter, and a ſtrict Ligature.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of a moveable round Tumour of the Lower-Lip.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Young man Twenty three years of age, ſhewed to me a round Tumor in his Lower-Lip, movable and ſomewhat painful, which (in the mean while) was not a little troubleſome by reaſon of its bulk, that equalized one of thoſe Balls with which Children are wont to play; but its colour differed not from the colour of the Lip.</p>
                  <p>This Patient, three Months before, had
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59518:61"/>with his Teeth bit his Lower Lip, and from that time he perceived this Tumor. Now there is ſcarcely any man (skill'd in Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgy) that knows not how many very ſmall Glandules are inſerted, not onely in all the other parts of the Mouth, but alſo in the Lower Lip; one of which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſo hurt, that the Humors (paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing but from the ſmall Artery, their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage being ſhut up) ſetled in the Glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, and by that means the ſmall Glandule increaſed to ſuch a large Tumour, as is here (in this <hi>Obſervation</hi>) by me deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Although this Tumour often occurs in the practice of our Art, yet I know no man that hath explained the <hi>Cauſe</hi> thereof, and and but One onely that hath by Example deſcribed the <hi>Cure</hi> of the ſame, <hi>viz. Job Van Meeckeren</hi> Chyrurgeon of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> who (if my memory fail me not) to this Affect gave a name, which (in the Dutch <hi>Idiom</hi>) is <hi>een ſteen knoop.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why do you wonder? that ſo very ſmall a Glandule ſhould be extended to ſo great a magnitude? Conſider, I pray, how much the magnitude of one and the ſame Womb differs in a Virgin, and in a Woman with Child. Peruſe the Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the moſt famous <hi>John Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks (Ultra-jectine Profeſſor)</hi> publiſhed <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 20, in the year 1678. in which he declares, that the Womb of a certain maid
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59518:62"/>was ſo largely extended that it did contain 112 Pounds of Water.</p>
                  <p>Why do you yet doubt? I ſhall here of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer yet one Experiment which comes more near to our purpoſe. I myſelf, when I was at any time above meaſure hurt by Cold, have often found the Glandules about the Neck (which in a ſtate of health I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find by the touch) to increaſe to ſo great a bulk, that they have exceeded the largeneſs of a Pidgeons-Egg.</p>
                  <p>But now at laſt to haſten to the Cure, I ſay, Medicaments can neither be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly applied nor retained in ſuch a place; therefore I took away the whole Tumour (at one time) by Section with a Knife, and healed the remaining Wound with <hi>Honey of Roſes</hi> onely.</p>

                     <p>Of an Affect of the Month, by us vulgarly called <hi>De Water-Kanker.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I Not long ſince ſaw a Man-child two years old (who had for three whole Months been afflicted with a Quartane Fever) and between his Upper-lip and Gum I found an Ulcer (which took be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning four days before) ſufficiently ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upwards, hollow, hard, painful, blac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh and ill-ſmelling.</p>
                  <p>The Bloud of this ſick Child, by his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid and ſowering Meat and Drink, as alſo by his long continued Quartane, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come much more acid than was fit, and (being ſuch) did not ſo much ſettle any where, as between the Upper-Lip and the Gum; becauſe the Bloud and Humors are there eaſily coagulated by the cold Air, (admitted by Inſpiration) alſo by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of Meats ſticking between the Teeth, and by their delay there contracting ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:59518:63"/>
                  <p>The Bloud and Humors ſtagnizing did in time become very corroſive, and ſo not onely much vellicated the Fibrils of the Lip and Gum, but alſo broak in ſunder many of them; and by this means a deep, hard, hollow, and painful Ulcer took be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
                  <p>But that we may the better find out the reaſon of the ſoon-after-induced Blackneſs, I think good firſt to declare, that I, not long ſince, did (by the help of my <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope</hi>) look upon a ſmall piece of white Linnen, and all the Fibrils with which the Threads were twiſted, appeared tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as Ice; but every Thred, made of thoſe pellucid Fibrils, were to the ſight white; no otherwiſe than as Water ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears pellucid, but the Froath (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of many Superficies of the Water, ſo ſuperpoſited one above another, that much Air is contained within them) preſents it ſelf white to the fight.</p>
                  <p>But when I had burned this Linnen, not onely all the Threds, but alſo all the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brils of them preſented to my ſight (ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened by the <hi>Microſcope</hi>) a black colour, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the Pores in the Linnen were much diſtorted by the force of Fire, and many Particles flew away from the burning Linnen in the form of Smoak, inſomuch that the Solar-Rays (ſuffocated in thoſe Pores) could not be reflected to my Eye.</p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:59518:63"/>
                  <p>Now what Fire effected in the Linnen, the ſame did the Acido-corroſive Particles effect in the Ulcer, when they brake in ſunder the Fibrils, and otherwiſe figured and changed the Pores of them; yea, they compelled many Particles to evaporate from the Ulcer in the form of Vapour, as was manifeſt by the ſtink.</p>
                  <p>But that I may remove from many their cauſe of wonder, that I ſhould write, that Acidity concurs to the inducing of Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I would have them to examine how good Ink may be made with a Decoction of Galls in Vinegar, in which filings of Steel have been firſt infuſed: Or (at leaſt) let them cut a <hi>Pome-citron</hi> with a Knife, and they will ſoon ſee the Knife to wax very black.</p>
                  <p>Now the evil Odour of the Ulcer onely remains to be explained. Wherefore, that the aforeſaid Compariſon may in this place alſo be ſubſervient to me, let any man ſmell to that ungrateful Odour which in burning of Linnen is wont to penetrate his Noſtrils. For, what Fire acts in reſpect of Linnen, the ſame operates the Acido-cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive humor in an Ulcer, whilſt it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts many Particles of the Volatile Salt (which in an healthful ſtate is in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance contained in the parts of the Humane Body, and in the parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of other Animals, as Diſtillation plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59518:64"/>ſhews) changeth their Figures, and ſo cauſeth them, their Bonds with which they were before tied being broken, to fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; at which time, by the Air, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they mix themſelves, forced into the Noſtrils, they affect the Fibrils of the Nerves (ſubſervient to <hi>Smelling</hi>) with too great trembling, and ſo to the Mind is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited a conception of evilly-ſmelling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Phaenomenons</hi> of this Diſeaſe, ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten occurring in the <hi>Praxis,</hi> and by no man (that I know of) as yet ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained and diſcourſed of, it will be all one to me, whether (with <hi>Hildanus</hi>) it be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Gangreen;</hi> with <hi>Charles Battus</hi> a <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer;</hi> or with <hi>Cornelius vander Voorden,</hi> an <hi>Eating Ulcer;</hi> ſeeing I little regard thoſe mere Diſputes about the name, being affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with nothing ſo much as the matter it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>This Evil augments very ſwiftly, and may (in a ſhort time ſtrangle the ſick, as I (two Months before) experienced in a Maiden-Child four years old; which was brought to me (the fifth day after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of the Diſeaſe) ſo deformed, as ſhe ſeemed not to reſemble Humane kind. For half her Noſe, and a fourth part of her Tongue was already conſumed, her left Cheek hard as a ſtone, perforated with a great hole; by reaſon of which and other
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59518:64"/>Symptomes, according to my Prognoſtick, ſhe died within four days.</p>
                  <p>Therefore theſe things being by me ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſidered, I preſcribed the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Unguent reſiſting corroſive Acidity.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>A Maiden-Infant, Fourteen days old, was deformed with a very red Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, void of pain, which ſhe had contracted whilſt in the Womb. For the Mother of this Infant, when with child, was wounded in her Forehead. From that Wound, which inferred great dolour, much Bloud iſſued out. Wherefore the Mother, willing to be more certain of her own misfortune, haſtned to a Looking-glaſs, and ſo was not a little terrified.</p>
                  <p>Now who knows not how ſtrict the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is between the Mother and her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant in the Womb? This ſhould not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a wonder, ſeeing the Circulation of the Bloud is common to both.</p>
                  <p>In the Hoſpital in <hi>Paris,</hi> a Fool is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have lived till Twenty years of age, the Bones of whoſe Legs, Arms, and other
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59518:65"/>parts were broken from his Nativity. The reaſon of this was, becauſe his Mother (when with child of him) had, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out terrour, beheld the Bones of a certain Malefactor publickly broken by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Hangman.</p>
                  <p>If a pregnant Mother can impreſs ſo great evils upon her tender Young, when ſhe ſees another afflicted with great dolour, conſider what greater evil may happen when ſhe both ſees and feels (in her proper body) a bleeding Wound.</p>
                  <p>But to write of the way how this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens (that being little conducent to the Practick part) I ſhall in this place forbear. If any man be more curious in this matter, let him peruſe <hi>L. de la Forge</hi> his <hi>Annotations</hi> upon <hi>Carteſius</hi> his Treatiſe of Man; alſo that moſt acute Author of a certain French Treatiſe (intituled <hi>La Recherche de la Verité</hi>) who very elegantly there diſcourſeth of this Effect, and how it is produced.</p>
                  <p>Having beheld and obſerved this Tumor, I applied to it a Corroſive, compoſed onely of <hi>Calx vive</hi> and <hi>common Soap</hi> mixt together which was extended all over the Tumor, and by that means an Eſchar was indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Common Soap</hi> is made of a ſtrong <hi>Lixivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> and Fatneſs ſo long boiled together, as until the many ſmall ſtrings of the fat Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are broken in ſunder; as is evident
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59518:66"/>by this, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe fatneſs produceth Spots (in Clothes) pertinaciouſly inherent by reaſon of thoſe ſtringy Particles, with which it infolds it ſelf within the Fibrils of the Cloth, and <hi>Soap</hi> (on the contrary) is eaſily waſhed off with Water only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Calx vive</hi> is an <hi>Alcalick</hi> fixed, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently acid Salt. Therefore it is mixed with Water, becauſe that (by reaſon of its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcency with the <hi>Calx</hi>) infringeth the powers of the ſame; not with Fatneſs, which too much obſtructs the Pores of the Skin; but with <hi>common Soap</hi> (by its own <hi>Lixivial Salt</hi>) not a little helping the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the <hi>Calx.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Corroſive being applied, the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours (in their uſual manner) paſſed out from the ſmall Arteries, through the Pores of the <hi>Cutis</hi> into the Air, by which they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain forced, into the place they left, a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile matter, which (in its tranſit) agitated both the ſaline Particles of the <hi>Calx,</hi> and the ſlippery, rigid, and pungent Particles of the <hi>Soap,</hi> and carried them (with it ſelf) up to the <hi>Cutis;</hi> and indeed according to the <hi>Longitude,</hi> not according to the <hi>Latitude</hi> of the Particles: as an Arrow ſhot up on high cuts the Air, not tranſverſively, but by its Longitude; becauſe thus it finds leſs reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and a more eaſie way in the Air.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſaline Particles driven up to the <hi>Cutis,</hi> and by the ſubtile matter egregiouſly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59518:66"/>agitated there, broke the Fibrils of the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> in ſuch wiſe, that the ſmall paſſages of the ſame were in ſo great a meaſure diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the circulation of the Bloud, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and Spirits, was there wholly impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; that part died, preſenting it ſelf under the form of an Eſchar; which being (in a ſhort time) ſeparated, all the Tumor vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Seeing this, I applied my <hi>Placentula</hi> (in a form ſomewhat hard) of which I have often made mention, which compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Fleſh (otherwiſe eaſily luxuriant) and induced a thin <hi>Cicatrice,</hi> which was indeed at firſt ſomewhat red; but that redneſs was afterward wholly taken away, when that thin skin had been ſeveral times touched gently with <hi>Oyl of Tartar per Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Forehead of this Child being (by theſe means) happily freed from all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, Chyrurgeons ſhould hence be excited to endeavour the removal of many like deformed Blemiſhes and Tumors in Infants (impreſſed whilſt they were held captive in the Priſon of the Womb) which by many have been accounted inſana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

                     <p>Of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer, with Rottenneſs of the Jaw-Bone.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Matron, aged 28 years, was afflicted with a ſmall, deep, and dolorous Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of her Under-Jaw, from which daily iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out a great abundance of <hi>Pus,</hi> and ſpungious fleſh was always luxuriant in the Ulcer, and the Tooth nigh the Ulcer was excavated with rottenneſs, and beſides, no ſmall hardneſs preſented it ſelf to the touch of the finger.</p>
                  <p>According to the relation of the Patient, this Ulcer derived its Original from a great and large Tumour of the Lower-Jaw, and alſo of half the Face, which (ſuppurated and ſpontaneouſly opened) emitted much <hi>Pus</hi> into the cavity of the Mouth; but this Aperture was in a ſhort time healed by the Spittle contained in the Mouth. This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Tumour was opened by the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons Knife, and that Aperture for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Weeks after yielded to no remedies.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I, being called, gave accurate heed to all Circumſtances, and exactly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59518:67"/>examined them, and ſo at length (ſhunning all precipitate raſhneſs in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) moſt aſſuredly perſwaded my ſelf, that the Bone of the lower Jaw was rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and that was principally evident to me, by that always luxuriant fleſh, and by a greater abundance of <hi>Pus</hi> than the ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Ulcer could contain, had not the Bone been infected with rottenneſs.</p>
                  <p>But whence did that fungous fleſh in the Ulcer, luxuriating with the rottenneſs of the Bone, derive its Original? Satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to anſwer this Queſtion, thoſe things are to be called to mind which I mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Eighth <hi>Obſervation</hi> of the Firſt <hi>Decade,</hi> of which I there at large diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>viz.</hi> that rottenneſs of the Bone is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by an <hi>Acido-Corroſive:</hi> which alſo may be made more evident by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Example.</p>
                  <p>Caſt ſome Bones to be devoured by a Dog, and it will in a ſhort time be evident by his Excrements, that the compactneſs of the Bones ſwallowed is throughly diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Ferment contained in the Dogs Stomach, the Acidity of which, I judge there is no man will deny.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the corroſive Acidity corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and rotted the Bone, and opened the ſanguiferous Veſſels more than was fit, from which (then extended in length) the out-flowing Humor was formed into ſpongious Fleſh.</p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:59518:68"/>
                  <p>But whence was the ſo great abundance of <hi>Pus</hi> in the Ulcer, that attended the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs? That Ulcer was deep, ſo that not onely the Humors proceeding from the Skin and Fleſh, but alſo from the <hi>Perioſteum</hi> and Bone it ſelf, ſupplied matter for gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating that <hi>Pus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This rottenneſs I did firſt diſcern by the Eyes of my Mind, but I deſired ſenſibly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to be aſſured of that; and becauſe the ſtreightneſs of the Ulcer would not admit any Probe of Iron, I therefore uſed an <hi>Hogs Briſtle,</hi> and with that felt the Bone to be naked and rotten.</p>
                  <p>What was here to be done? the corroſive Acidity was to be temperated, and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the rotted Fragments of the Bone to be promoted, and the hardneſs in the parts adjacent to the Ulcer to be ſoftened.</p>
                  <p>But firſt of all I commanded the rotten Tooth to be drawn out, leſt it ſhould more infect the Jaw; but the root of the Tooth pulled out appeared uncorrupted.</p>
                  <p>Then into the Ulcer I put a <hi>Tent</hi> anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the following Unguent.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Turpentine</hi> reſiſts Acidity, as the Oyl thereof (waxing hot with the acid <hi>Oyl of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59518:68"/>Vitriol</hi>) plainly teacheth; ſo alſo Myrrh and Aloes (by their Salt, with which they abound) do temperate Acidity.</p>
                  <p>Alſo ſometimes, for the better opening the Ulcer, I ſtrewed upon the Tent <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> pulverized, which took away the Luxuriant fleſh, or I put in a Tent made of <hi>Gentian-root;</hi> but upon the Tent I uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrewed powder of <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> that it (by its own abounding Volatile Salt) might temperate the corroſive Acidity, and ſo not onely prevent the corrupting of the found part of the Bone, but alſo haſten the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Fragments affected with rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Luxuriant fleſh, riſing up above the Ulcer, I often applied <hi>Burnt Allom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To remove the hardneſs in the parts nigh the Ulcer, I applied <hi>Paracelſus</hi> his <hi>Stip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Plaiſter;</hi> which hardneſs was by this means removed in a ſhort time.</p>
                  <p>After I had for the ſpace of three months ſtudiouſly endeavoured the cure of this Ulcer, three white Fragments (one after the other) iſſued out of the Ulcer, the two firſt of which were very ſmall, but the third ſufficiently great and broad.</p>
                  <p>At that time, when ſome of the Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments began to be ſeparated, the <hi>Pus</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſanguineous, becauſe the ſanguife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Veſſels were hurt by thoſe Fragments. But whence the increaſe of Dolour then
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59518:69"/>derived its Original needs not here be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
                  <p>Here alſo it may eaſily be underſtood, that the moving Fragments gave increaſe to that abundance of <hi>Pus,</hi> and cauſed the Fleſh to be more luxuriant.</p>
                  <p>But how came theſe Fragments to be disjoyned? To explain this, it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooful to call upon Nature for help, which <hi>Empedocles</hi> hath long ſince exploded in the following words:</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>What Mortals now do Nature call,</l>
                     <l>Juſt nothing is.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Indeed I cannot but deride thoſe Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians who have theſe words always in their mouth, and are accounted as Oracles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nature is the Curatreſs of Diſeaſes, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician Nature's Miniſter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Whereas they themſelves know not, what they would have intended by theſe words ſignifying nothing; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they boldly enough utter before their Patients, by whom they are often accounted as Gods, by reaſon of their much babling.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us bid adieu to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and call it what in very deed it is, and what may clearly and diſtinctly be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by every man: that is to ſay, the Particles circulating through the ſound Bone, approached to the rotten and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Fragments; but could not contine
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59518:69"/>their courſe through them (becauſe tho ſmall paſſages were very much diſtorted) therefore with united force they daily very often ſtruck upon them, and ſo (as much as they could) tearing the Fibrils, which had as yet connexed the ſound Bone with its corrupted parts; and at length the acid Particles of the <hi>Pus</hi> (with the acuteneſs of their ſides) cut in ſunder theſe interſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Fibrils, which did the ſooner and more eaſily happen, becauſe the ſame Fibrils were very much diſtended; as we ſee a Thread ſtretched out to be moſt eaſily cut by a Knife, but a Thred hanging looſe cannot be ſo readily divided.</p>
                  <p>After the laſt of the Fragments was come out of the Ulcer, the abundance of <hi>Pus</hi> was ſoon diminiſhed, and the fungous fleſh (removed by burnt <hi>Allom</hi>) no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed again; and ſo the Ulcer was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloſed in the ſpace of four days, the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrice</hi> notwithſtanding remaining hollow and hard, which no mortal man can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in rottenneſs of a Bone: becauſe the nouriſhing Particles which circulate through the ſmall paſſages the Bone, and ſo come to that Superficies of the ſame Bone, from which the rotten Fragment was ſeparated, are much more ſolid than fleſhy Particles; therefore when there (by reaſon of the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of Superficies) they adhere to the extremity of the Bone, very firmly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59518:70"/>and connexed each with other, and ſo conſtitute (as it were) a certain ſmall <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of a Wound of the Leg inflicted by Gun ſhot.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Young man, aged Twenty four years, complained of a Wound of his Leg, (inflicted with a Shot) which was round, blackiſh, and very painful.</p>
                  <p>The Leaden bullet could not perforate this young Man's Leg, but did egregiouſly contuſe the ſame, whence aroſe that Dolour and blackneſs.</p>
                  <p>It is not my purpoſe in this place to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the means by which <hi>Gun-powder</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, and excited to a motion ſo very vehement and ſwift, that it can impreſs on a Leaden-bullet force ſufficient to produce ſuch a Wound; ſeeing <hi>Carteſius</hi> hath (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly and elegantly enough) writ of this matter, in his Fourth Part <hi>of the Principles of Philoſophy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore after the Patient came to me, I commanded him to ſet his Body in the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59518:70"/>ſame poſture he ſtood in when he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and then with a leaden Probe, yea alſo with a Wax-candle (which we in Dutch call <hi>een was-lichtien</hi>) I ſought very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly for the Bullet, but in vain; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it had deſcended too deeply, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſconded it ſelf ſo that I could not draw it out.</p>
                  <p>If any man be deſirous to ſee inſtruments fit for extracting Bullets, let him conſult <hi>Fabritius Hildanus, Scultetus</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>What then was here to be done? The Bloud and Humors (by reaſon of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion</hi>) ſtagnizing and (by reaſon of the Acidity) coagulated, were to be diſſolved by things temperating Acidity; that by ſuch means the Circulation of the Bloud and Humors (in ſuch wiſe impeded) might be again reſtored, and by that reſtoration the Fibrils (inherent and plainly dead in the Wound) be ſeparated from the living Fleſh, and the Wound again be filled up and repleat with new Fleſh, and cured; which, notwithſtanding the Leaden-bullet remaining in the Leg, was effected in a ſhort ſpace of time, by applying this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent, and ſuperpoſiting the following Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>

                  <p>But in the mean time we contributed help to the external Remedies, by internal Medicines alſo given; and often gave to the ſick (inſtead of a <hi>Vulnerary Potion</hi>) one Scruple of <hi>Crabs-Eyes,</hi> and as much of <hi>White Coral.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Ancients, about Wounds made by Gun-ſhot, laboured with great prejudice, thinking them to be venomous; and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes de Vigo</hi> had imbibed the ſame opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for he therefore touched ſuch Wounds with hot Oyl.</p>
                  <p>No leſs falſe is the Opinion of thoſe men, who believe a Leaden-bullet (ſhot out of a Gun) doth in perforating the Fleſh egregiouſly burn the ſame: For a Leaden-bullet ſhot againſt a Wall, and preſently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, will exhibit no ſenſible heat.</p>
                  <p>But whence is it, that Lead hath often been known to remain in the Humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy without any ſenſible hurt for a long ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of years; but Braſs, Iron, and many other things, from without forced inwards, not ſo? Do we not daily ſee in the <hi>Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſm</hi> how eaſily Braſs is infected with an
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59518:71"/>
                     <hi>Aerugo,</hi> and Iron with Ruſt, by the Air, Water, Vinegar, and other things; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as (on the contrary) Lead is infected with no <hi>Rubigo?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, Tin is likewiſe ſaid to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with no Ruſtineſs; wherefore this alſo, may perhaps for a very long time lie hid in our Bodies without damage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Helmont, Kenelm Digby,</hi> and others, much glory of the Symphatick cure of Wounds; but they are miſerably deceived. Sir <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelm Digby</hi> ſet a Veſſel full of Water in a cold place, and in that Water diſſolved <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Vitriol,</hi> and then (in that Solution) put a Linnen-cloath, that had before recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Bloud iſſuing from the Wound; and (doing this) thought that many Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the <hi>Vitriol</hi> would by the Air be carried to the Patients Wound; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps theſe Particles, could they be conveyed ſo far, would do more hurt than good. This ſeems to be very probable, becauſe thoſe <hi>Effluviums,</hi> which the Air can convey from the <hi>Vitriol</hi> ſet in a cold place, muſt needs be very few.</p>
                  <p>Before I put an end to this <hi>Obſervation</hi> there remains one Problem yet to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, <hi>viz.</hi> whether it be true, as many men at this time do firmly perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> that there are ſuch men in the world, who (by reaſon of a Compact made with the Devil) have Bodies impenetrable
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59518:72"/>by any Bullets, Swords, or other things impreſſing Wounds.</p>
                  <p>Although I have with great ſcrutiny ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined this matter, yet I could never unto this day find any man, who (by proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in his own Body) could aſcertain me of the truth of this matter.</p>
                  <p>But it is ſufficiently evident to be repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to reaſon, that the Humane Body (which is ſo very ſoft) cannot be wounded by Leaden-bullets, Swords, and other Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, agitated with very great force, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a Pellet of Wax, ſhot out of a Gun, can ſufficiently penetrate ſolid and hard Boards.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever is ſo repugnant to Reaſon, cannot be conſentaneous to the Will of God; for, otherwiſe he muſt needs will ſomewhat that is repugnant to his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſeeing <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Whatſoever <hi>GOD</hi> wills not, that the <hi>Devil</hi> cannot effect, therefore I judge this thing to be wholly impoſſible, and ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be induced to believe that ſuch men can be any where found.</p>

                  <p>From this Ulcer at one time proceeded thirty Eggs full of a limpid Humor; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for ſeveral days many other came forth; all which numbred together, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded one hundred: ſome of which were equal in magnitude to Hens-Eggs, others as large as Pidgeons-Eggs, and ſome of them no larger than Sparrows-Eggs; all of them, each apart from the other ſeparated, were encloſed with their proper Membrane, white and as thick as a Playing-card.</p>

                     <hi>Vigelius,</hi> profeſſor of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> is reported to have formed an <hi>Horſe of Metal,</hi> which in one day (for ſeveral hours) could by the help of <hi>Rotula's,</hi> walk like a living Beaſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rayſelius</hi> is reported to have fabricated an Engine like a man, in which a certain Liquor, poured into the mouth, was ſeen to circulate like our Bloud; the more thin part of which Liquor was expelled by the Yard as Urine; but the more groſs part as Dregs (or Dung) of the Belly, by the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament.</p>
                  <p>If Man can do ſuch things, what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>GOD</hi> (the ſupream Architect) ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect according to the ordinary rules of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
                  <p>Therefore how were theſe Eggs produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in this Woman? I anſwer. In the Thigh of this Woman, from this or that cauſe, many Pores of this or that Artery were diſtorted and enlarged; ſo that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Humors flowed out, and were collected
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59518:74"/>in one place, in which (when they began to be fermented) the Particles, ſtringy and leſs apt for motion, were thruſt out to the ſides, where they were not compelled to ſo ſwift a motion; and there cohering and twiſting themſelves one within the other, were formed into that ſufficiently groſs Membrane, which did include all the Eggs afterward generated.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe the Pores of the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Artery were diverſly diſtorted, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome of the Particles contained in this groſs Membrane did in ſome meaſure differ from the other in figure and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and perhaps the Particles like each other, flowed into almoſt an hundred di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places; and ſo every of thoſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles (beſides the Congeſture of their like) ſtill exerciſing a certain kind of Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did again thruſt out the more ſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy Particles to the ſides; and ſo were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Membranes, in which were inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all the Eggs.</p>
                  <p>Thus, I ſuppoſe, I have produced a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently intelligible cauſe of this <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon,</hi> which I beheld with my own Eyes.</p>

                     <p>Of a vaſt Tumor of the Neck.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Young Maid, aged Fifteen years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe very well, had (now for ſix years) ſuſtained an hard round Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor in her Neck, (of the ſame colour with the Skin, and void of pain) equalizing in magnitude a white Loaf that is wont to be ſold at the price of half a <hi>Seſterce,</hi> and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably defacing the Patients Countenance.</p>
                  <p>I judged the humidity of this Tumor to be very viſcous, and divided almoſt after the ſame manner as we ſee the Juice in a <hi>Pome-Citron</hi> or <hi>Orange,</hi> contained in many Cells.</p>
                  <p>By reaſon of the viſcoſity of the Humor, this Tumor could not be diſcuſſed, nor (in the common way) brought to ſuppuration; therefore I applied a Corroſive, and (the Eſchar being removed) put in a Tent anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the <hi>Unguent Baſilicon</hi> mixt with common <hi>Turpentine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this means ſome part of the viſcous <hi>Pus</hi> iſſued out daily, and ſo the Bulk of this horrid Tumor began to be diminiſhed; the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59518:75"/>viſcous Humor neareſt the hole was firſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuated, and afterward that alſo which lay far remote from the Ulcer.</p>
                  <p>But when the ſmall paſſages round about this hole (made by Art) were obſtructed by the viſcoſity of the Humor, as it often hapned; then, with the Unguent where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Tent was anointed, I mixed ſome <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> that ſo an Eſchar might be induced; which being ſeparated, the ſmall paſſages were again opened; and ſo this young Maid in the ſpace of three Months was wholly freed from this Tumor, and that great deformity attending it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not in this place ſpeak of the way or manner of the Corroſives operating, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already diſcourſed of that, in the Firſt <hi>Obſervation</hi> of this Third <hi>Decade;</hi> nor will I at this time further explain by what means the Eſchar is ſeparated; becauſe this may ſufficiently be underſtood by the Second <hi>Obſervation</hi> of this <hi>Decade,</hi> where I teach, how the rotten Fragments of Bones may be ſeparated from the ſound part.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps ſome one will wonder that I uſe Medicaments ſo few and ſo little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; but to what purpoſe are ſo many Simples, and ſo many composed Forms of Remedies, which many Phyſicians uſe at this day, for no other cauſe than to boaſt of their vain Learning before the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant?</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of a wonderful Abſceſs.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Man Fifty years of age, was vexed with an <hi>Abſceſs</hi> ariſing below his Ear, which was round, painful, wateriſh, and ſoft; with this he had been afflicted ſome days before he came to me.</p>
                  <p>I, being certainly perſwaded, that ripe <hi>Pus</hi> was contained in this <hi>Abſceſs,</hi> made an Aperture with my Lancet; and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59518:76"/>iſſued out no ſmall quantity of white ſhining <hi>Pus,</hi> but when I would, by preſſure with my finger, in ſome meaſure further the efflux of the <hi>Pus;</hi> behold ſoon after a piece of a Tobacco-pipe (equalizing the length of the Middle-finger) preſented it ſelf to ſight; which, with an Inſtrument I drew out of the lately-made Orifice.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pus</hi> being gradually evacuated, I in a ſhort ſpace of time healed this Affect af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of other <hi>Abſceſſes;</hi> ſo that (in this Cure) nothing hapned worthy of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
                  <p>But the piece of Tobacco-pipe unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly iſſuing out of this <hi>Abſceſs,</hi> gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the By-ſtanders not onely of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo rare a <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> but alſo made them preſently to fly to the Devil and his Inchantments.</p>
                  <p>The Ignorant (and therefore ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and miſerable) vulgar men, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haſten to the Devil, the accuſtomed (but impious) <hi>Aſylus</hi> of their ignorance; when any Effect preſents it ſelf to them, the like of which they never before ſaw.</p>
                  <p>If they ſee any thing the cauſe of which they know not, they do not preſently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe that to the Devil, having often before beheld the ſame; ſo the ſtupendious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that Belching out of Fire (which cannot but be known by all the Inhabitants of theſe Regions) are by them accounted
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59518:77"/>natural, and not taken for deluſions of the Devil, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe theſe are ſuch things as they have often ſeen, though they cannot render a reaſon of them, being wholly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>So, ſometime ſince, there was an <hi>Italian</hi> (at <hi>Lugdunum</hi> in <hi>Batavia</hi>) who after the drinking a great quantity of clear Water, vomited up the ſame into various Chryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Veſſels, not limpid as before, but it was (in every of the Veſſels) of a diverſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and taſte.</p>
                  <p>This effect frequently ſeen, excited the people (ignorant of the cauſe) to ſo great admiration, that they uttered not ſo much as one Whiſper about the Devil. But Mr. <hi>Overcamp</hi> preſently found out the cauſe of this <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> as he relates <hi>(In primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genito Ingenii ſui Partu) viz.</hi> that in the Chryſtalline Veſſels he both ſaw and ſmelt divers ſubtile Oyls, which in one Veſſel tinged the Water with one colour, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with another.</p>
                  <p>Not without reaſon did <hi>Virgil</hi> ſay <hi>(Felix qui potuit Rerum cognoſcere Cauſas;)</hi> He was happy that knew the Cauſes of things: For they being known, we ſhall not much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at <hi>Phaenomenons</hi> before ſeen, much leſs (with the decieved Vulgar) refer them to a certain imaginary power of the Devil; whereas it is well underſtood, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people ſeldom have any regard to the cauſes of things.</p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:59518:77"/>
                  <p>But, omitting theſe, what was the reaſon that a piece of a Tobacco-pipe came forth of this Affect whereof we are now writing? When I had well examined the Patient, I by him underſtood, that (about ſix Months before) when he walked in the ſtreets ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Tobacco, he fell down, and internally hurt his Jaws with the Pipe, from which hurt abundance of Bloud did often flow out, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe a piece of the Pipe bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, deeply forced into his Jaw, firſt produced this <hi>Haemorrhagia,</hi> and afterward the above-recited external <hi>Abſceſs</hi> below the Ear, out of which when opened the piece of Pipe was taken.</p>

                  <p>A Little Boy five years old, ſuddenly complained of a pain of his Yard, and could not make water.

                  <p>Then I commanded the Mother to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply her mouth to her young Son's Yard, and ſuck (for ſome time) as much as ſhe could, and by this means the Stone was (in a ſhort time) drawn forward to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity of the Ureter, from whence then it was eaſily drawn out with the Forceps; and ſo this little Boy was quickly, ſafely, and pleaſantly freed from this ſo very pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Affect.</p>
                  <p>We muſt ſpeak with the Vulgar, but not judge with them according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Proverb. I ſaid, the Mother ſucked, though in the mean while I am certainly perſwaded, that Sucking effects little, but all Motion is made by Pulſion. It is true the Mother, applying her Mouth to the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59518:78"/>Yard, and ſtrictly cloſing it round about with her Lips, cauſed the Belly to ſwell by contraction of the <hi>Diaphragma;</hi> and ſo the external Air, by its preſſure, forced the ſmall Stone to the extremity of the Yard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the mouth of the Mother: which did ſo much the more eaſily happen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that little Air (contained in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mouth) by the heat there exiſting ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; and ſo being more weak than the external Air, forced from the ſwelling <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen,</hi> made the leſs reſiſtance, as rarified Air (contained under a <hi>Cuppin-glaſs</hi> made hot) prevents not the ſubjected <hi>Cutis</hi> from being lifted up into a Tumor, the preſſure of the external Air contributing thereunto. This Propulſion of the Stone was alſo not a little furthered by the almoſt continual agitation of the Tongue commodiouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
                  <p>But no man ſhould here wonder, that the preſſure of the Air hath ſo great force; for this effects many other things much more wonderful, and is the cauſe that two <hi>Braſs-Hemiſpheres,</hi> from which the Air hath been (in a great meaſure) removed by a <hi>Wind-Inſtrument,</hi> do ſo very firmly adhere each to other, that the weight of a Thouſand pounds would not be ſufficient to ſeparate them again; whereas they may very eaſily be disjoyned, when the Air is again intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; as I with my eyes have beheld (at

                     <p>Of a Contuſion ſuddenly healed.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Man about Thirty years of age, in a <hi>Tennis-Court,</hi> received a Ball, with great force ſtruck by a Racket, juſt upon his right Eye, whence exceeding great do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour preſently aroſe.</p>
                  <p>The Patient remembred, that he had ſeen others after the ſame manner hurt, to be preſently healed by cold Water onely, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied immediately after the ſtroak, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he preſently to the contuſed part ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his <hi>Handkercheif</hi> moiſtned with cold Water, and when that waxed warm, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain dipped it in other freſh cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>The next day after this hurt, his Friends that had heard of his misfortune, came to viſit him; but ſeeing both eyes very ſound
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59518:79"/>and well, they were amazed, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firmly perſwaded themſelves, that the eye which had received ſo vehement a ſtroak, muſt needs be livid and very pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>But what may hence be inferred? Can cold Water profit in a Contuſion? It ſeems more likely to do hurt; becauſe it incraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſates, coagulates and ſtagnizeth the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſate Bloud. Would not <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and other Medicaments (that increaſe the motion of the Bloud) be more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient in this caſe?</p>
                  <p>That you may the more clearly conceive the ſolution of this difficulty, it is behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to know, that in the parts hurt (by the Ball ſo forcibly driven) certain very ſmall ſanguiferous Veſſels were opened, which had they (before the Water was applied) poured out the Bloud into the ſmall paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Parts hurt, then the cold Water would have done hurt: but this cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was applied before the Bloud iſſued out, and ſo not onely (by its coldneſs) again cloſed theſe very ſmall Veſſels, but alſo was the cauſe that no new Bloud could (for a certain ſpace of time) enter the ſame Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. So we ſee our Face to be red, for no other reaſon than becauſe, through the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> of the ſame very many ſmall Veſſels full of Bloud lie diſperſed; and diſcern the ſame to wax pale by the coldneſs of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59518:80"/>Air, and other things; becauſe ſuch coldneſs for a time prohibits the Bloud from entring theſe very ſmall Veſſels of the Face.</p>
                  <p>So we ſee the pleaſant redneſs of the Lips in a beautiful Virgin, augmented by the kiſs of a young man, to be changed into a pallid colour, by Acidity reſtraining the Bloud from entring the ſmall Veſſels diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted throughout the Superficies of the Lips.</p>
                  <p>But whoſoever he be, that will attempt ſuch a way of Cure as this here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, after the ſmall paſſages of the parts contuſed ſhall be replete with extravaſate Bloud, ſeems to me to be not well in his wits: for I have not ſeldom known a <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene</hi> to ariſe in a part contuſed, from the unſeaſonable application of cold and aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent things.</p>

                  <p>Perhaps ſome one will wonder, and not believe it poſſible, that the <hi>Glandules</hi> of the <hi>Omentum</hi> ſhould increaſe to ſo great a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitude, as to become the cauſe of ſo great and hard a Tumor, as was in the <hi>Abdomen</hi> of this Child perceptible by the touch; but I would have him peruſe <hi>Fabritius Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus,</hi> who (in the 62 <hi>Obſervation</hi> of his <hi>Third Century</hi>) declares, that he opened a Carcaſs, the <hi>Omentum</hi> of which, by reaſon
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59518:81"/>of the tumified <hi>Glandules,</hi> weighed Fifty ſix pounds.</p>
                  <p>Things being thus, I judged nothing would be more profitable than <hi>Paracelſus</hi> his <hi>Stiptick Plaiſter,</hi> which I commanded to be applied to the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> after it was ſpread upon a Linnen Cloath, and anointed with <hi>Oyl of Nutmegs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To correct the viſcous and acid Bloud, I commanded certain drops of oyly Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt to be given daily twice a day; and by this means our little Patient in the ſpace of a few Months, was happily reſtored to her priſtine ſtate of health.</p>

                     <p>Of the Scurvey.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Man, aged Thirty years, every day evily accuſtoming himſelf to viſcous and ſowre Aliments (according to the bad cuſtom of the <hi>Gelders</hi>) was afflicted with heavineſs and dolour of his hands and Feet; his Gums (in a great meaſure conſumed) would bleed with the leaſt touch; his Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle was in taſte ſalt as Brine.</p>
                  <p>Having diligently conſidered theſe things,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59518:81"/>I judged the Bloud (too acid and viſcous) to be here peccant, which (by reaſon of Acidity) inferred that dolour of Hands and Feet, and corroded the Gum and its ſanguiferous Veſſels; and by its too great Viſcoſity did ſo obſtruct the ſmall paſſages of the Hands and Feet, that the uſually-free tranſit of the Animal Spirits into the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles was ſomewhat impeded, whence aroſe the aforeſaid <hi>Heavineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſpeak here of the <hi>Animal Spirits;</hi> for ſeeing the Liquor that is through the Nerves (for exciting motion) carried into the Muſcle, is ſubtile; I know not why this Nervous Liquor ſhould leſs deſerve to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignized with the name of Spirit, than that Liquor which (in Chymical Diſtillation) is extracted from <hi>Hartſhorn.</hi> But omitting vain Diſputes about the Name let us ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Matter</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>This Diſeaſe is very familiar in theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, and is generally known by the name of <hi>The Scurvey,</hi> and is moſt difficultly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if (in proceſs of time) it have taken deep root.

                  <p>I commanded the Patient to take 16 drops of this Medicine thrice a day in a Decoction of the Tops of Firr; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to the end that the <hi>Spirits of Scurvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſs,</hi> and <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> and the <hi>Tincture of May-worms,</hi> with the aforeſaid Decoction, might attenuate the viſcous Bloud and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe the Acidity thereof. I added <hi>Oyl of Tartar per deliquium,</hi> that by this means the Volatile Salt of the Bloud (ſubdued and bound by the Acidity) might again recover its priſtine liberty, and ſo render the Bloud more fluid and more agile.</p>
                  <p>As we ſee the <hi>Volatile Salt of Hartſhorn,</hi> or any other Volatile Salt, coagulated and conjoyned with an Acid Spirit, with the help of an <hi>Alkali-Salt</hi> and <hi>Common Water,</hi> by diſtillation to be again reſtored to its priſtine liberty, and ſeparated from that Acidity.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Tincture of May-worms,</hi> it is to be obſerved that that ought not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with the acid Spirit of Salt, (as Artiſts are wont to do) becauſe by this means the Volatile Salt of the <hi>May-worms</hi> is infringed and enervated.</p>
                  <p>By theſe Remedies our Scorbutick Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient was cured in a ſhort time.</p>

No. I promiſe to unfold this Riddle in few words. No ſmall quantity of Volatile Salt contained in the Bloud (with the Acidity) was coagulated; therefore the Spittle (burthened with this Coagulate) exhibited the afore-mentioned Saline taſte to the Tongue. So <hi>Common Salt,</hi> which we daily uſe with our Meats, ceaſeth not to taſte Saline, though it hath not a little Acidity permixt with it ſelf, as <hi>Spirit of Salt</hi> extracted by Chymical Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation doth plainly teach.</p>

                     <p>Concerning the Indiſpoſition of the Gum.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Matron Forty years of age, very much afflicted with the <hi>Scurvey,</hi> complained of an exceſſive pain of her Gum, which was very much corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and (at the leaſt touch) immediately poured out Bloud: and beſides, her fore-Teeth were looſe. Alſo the Patient (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common cuſtom) after Bloud-letting, had been often purged, but in vain.</p>
                  <p>How the <hi>Acidity</hi> (in ſome ſort corroſive) ſhould be the cauſe of this dolour, corrode the Gum, and make the Teeth looſe, I forbear in this place to explain; becauſe I judge the caſe to be ſufficiently clear of it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>This Evil doth ſometimes degenerate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Malady, which we in <hi>Dutch</hi> call, <hi>De Water-kanker;</hi> therefore not to be ſlightly regarded.</p>
                  <p>My order was, that the ſick Woman
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59518:83"/>ſhould (as much as was poſſible) abſtain from acid things, and unto her I gave the Spirit, of which I ſpake in the laſt <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the foregoing <hi>Decade;</hi> and did alſo preſcribe the following Medicament to be externally uſed.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>℞ <hi>Tincture of Gum Lacca,</hi> ℥j.</item>

                  <p>With this Medicament the Gum was four times a day touched, and waſhed; and ſo in a few days the diſeaſed Woman was freed from her pain, and the out-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bloud from the Gum ceaſed, and the Teeth were no longer looſe; but that part of the Gum that was eaten away grew up no more: at which no man ſhould won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, becauſe it is as impoſſible for part of the Gum conſumed to be regenerated as a Finger once cut off to grow again.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes a certain Lapideous matter grows upon the Teeth, which by its rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lacerates the Gum; in which caſe the precedent Medicament muſt in no wiſe be uſed, unleſs this Lapideous matter be firſt removed with ſome fit Inſtrument.</p>
                  <p>If you deſire to know the way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring <hi>Tincture of Gum Lacca,</hi> conſult <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Deckers</hi> (that moſt famous Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) in his <hi>Practical Obſervations</hi> about the <hi>Method of Healing,</hi> page 15.</p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:59518:84"/>
                  <p>Before I finiſh this <hi>Obſervation,</hi> I cannot forbear to tax the frequent errour of thoſe men who uſe <hi>Oyl of Vitriol</hi> for whitening black Teeth. For though this immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly takes away the blackneſs of the Teeth, yet it afterward hurts them; becauſe it corrupts the Volatile Salt, which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally found in great abundance in the Teeth. It would be far better for thoſe that delight in white Teeth, always after Meat to waſh and cleanſe their Mouths with pure Water, and (once in a Week) rub their Teeth with the powder of <hi>Porcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane Earth,</hi> which is <hi>China.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any man, either cannot or will not give credit to my words, ſaying; Acidity (as <hi>Oyl of Vitriol,</hi> and other like things) hurts the Teeth, let him at leaſt give credit to <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſeſt of Kings, who ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the <hi>Spirit of GOD,</hi> ſaid; <hi>As Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar to the Teeth, and as Smoak to the Eyes, ſo is the Sluggard to them that ſend him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if <hi>Vinegar</hi> (according to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Solomon</hi>) be ſo inimical to the Teeth, what damage will not <hi>Oyl of Vitriol</hi> infer, which is much more ſharp, and far more corroſive?</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>A Man Thirty years of age, ſetting fire to <hi>Gun-powder,</hi> burnt his whole <hi>Face</hi> and both his <hi>Hands,</hi> whence preſently aroſe redneſs and exceeding great pain; to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage which the Patient applied Ink, which was (as it hapned) ready at hand.</p>
                  <p>Had you ſeen the Patient in this ſtate, you would have affirmed you ſaw the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, unleſs you could (with the <hi>Aethiopians</hi>) perſwade your ſelf the Devil is white, which Opinion Sir <hi>Thomas Brown</hi> (in his <hi>Pſeudoxia Epidemica</hi>) ſeems to favour, contrary to the Teſtimony of the holy Scripture, which ſaith (in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> Chap. 19. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.) <hi>The dwelling of Satan is a lake of Fire burning with Brimſtone.</hi> But the Smoak of Brimſtone burnt (as our above-recited Author philoſophizeth) is known by frequent experience to whiten Wollen Garments, as Stockings and other things; and hence he concludes, that whatſoever is found in Hell, muſt needs be white. Theſe things onely curſorily mentioned, let
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59518:85"/>us omit them and come to the matter it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>I being called to the Patient, applied to the parts hurt <hi>Onions</hi> bruiſed, with <hi>common Honey.</hi> Which Remedy is very profitable to burnt parts, if preſently applied, whilſt the Skin is yet entire: for that being hurt, vehement dolour will undoubtedly follow the uſe of this Medicament; which ſhews, that then it is in no wiſe convenient.</p>
                  <p>The next day many Bliſters, all over his Face and both his Hands, preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſight, which (the third day after the accident) being opened, poured out no ſmall quantity of Limpid Water.</p>
                  <p>Then I preſcribed the following Cerot.</p>

                     <hi>Make a Cerot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the preparation of which it is to be noted, that to the Oyl and Wax firſt mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, the Pouders (beaten very fine and ſifted) muſt be added, and when theſe are almoſt cold, the aforeſaid Pulp muſt be mixed, which Pulp is thus extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: The Roots are firſt made clean, and then cut into thin round ſlices, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards boyled in common Water till they
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59518:85"/>are ſoft, are then ſqueezed through a fine Linnen-Cloath.</p>
                  <p>With three Ounces of this Cerot I mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as much of <hi>Unguentum Aureum,</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of which is found in the <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> or <hi>Auguſtine Pharmacopoea;</hi> and this Medicament ſpread upon fine and ſoft Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Clothes I applied to the parts hurt; and by this means our Patient was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly healed in a ſhort time.</p>
                  <p>Whence the redneſs and dolour procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you may eaſily underſtand, if you do but conſider, that the <hi>Gun-powder</hi> fired, and ſo poſited in a moſt ſwift and very vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment motion, had hurt and broke many Fibrils of the <hi>Cutis.</hi> For hence the dolour manifeſting it ſelf in that Ambuſtion, may eaſily be judged of: the continuation of which <hi>Dolour</hi> proceeded from the Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of many ſmall paſſages (by reaſon of the broken Fibrils) in which the Humors ſtagnized, and diſtended the adjacent parts, and then alſo waxed acid, and by this means tore and cut in ſunder the aforeſoid Fibrils. The Bliſters were raiſed by the Humors ſtagnizing and coacervated about the <hi>Cutis</hi> which (being conſtringed by the flame) they could not penetrate.</p>
                  <p>I applied <hi>Onions</hi> with <hi>Honey,</hi> that (with their abounding Volatile Salt) they might open the conſtringed and ſtopt Pores of the <hi>Cuticle,</hi> temperate the acid Humors, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59518:86"/>reſtore to them their uſual Circulation.</p>
                  <p>The third day I opened the Bliſters; for had I ſooner opened them, the ſubjacent <hi>Cutis</hi> would have ſuffered and been too much pained, not onely by the ambient Air, but alſo by the Medicaments; but u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually on the third day is formed a Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a new <hi>Cuticle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then I applied the above-preſcribed Cerot with <hi>Unguentum Aureum,</hi> for tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the peccant Acidity.</p>
                  <p>Where the parts were only ſlightly burnt; that is, where the Fibrils or the <hi>Cutis</hi> were onely much agitated by force of the Fire, but none (or few of them) broken in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and where the <hi>Cuticle</hi> was onely light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhrunk, there <hi>Oyl of Tartar per Deliquium</hi> would have ſufficed, <hi>viz.</hi> if the affeted part had been lightly touched therewith; becauſe ſo the Pores of the <hi>Cuticle</hi> and ſmall paſſages of the <hi>Cutis</hi> would have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and the Acor of the ſtagnizing Humors temperated; as I (not long ſince) did experience in my ſelf, when I burnt my Foot with boiling hot Coffee, which Burning was not without Dolour and Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                  <p>A Man Seventy years of age, was vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a very great and painful <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> in his <hi>Scrotum,</hi> which Tumor was of the ſame colour with the ſound Skin. He felt great dolour in his <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up whatſoever he aſſumed. Having been in this ſtate for 24 hours he implored my help.</p>
                  <p>Then did the ſick Man, by me exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, relate, that he had for a long ſeries of years been afflicted with an <hi>Hernia,</hi> which (the Bowel being fallen into the <hi>Scrotum</hi>) did often in a ſtrange manner afflict him; but ſo ſoon as the Bowel was again thruſt into its place he felt no diſcommodity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: but the Bowel had never before ſo long as now remained out of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and notwithſtanding all endeavours of the Patient, he could not put it up again.</p>
                  <p>To his Friends I declared his Diſeaſe to be full of danger, becauſe the Bowel had ſo long remained out of the <hi>Abdomen.</hi> So a man 40 years of age, travelling on foot
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59518:87"/>from <hi>Ultrajectum</hi> to <hi>Arenacum,</hi> was affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with an <hi>Hernia</hi> infeſting his <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and yet (after this) he walked on his Feet for full Four hours (with this <hi>Hernia</hi> he had alſo been formerly afflicted, but that was onely in his Groin) whence the Tumor very much increaſed, and was very hard and painful; the Patient in the mean while vomited continually, and was conſtrained to lodge for one whole cold night in Straw at a Rufticks houſe; the next day he was carried in a Coach (continually vomiting) to <hi>Arenacum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the Sick man was given a Mixture diſcuſſing Flatulencies, but that was ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by Vomiting; alſo three Clyſters were injected, but to no purpoſe. The Patient was laid in a good poſture, moiſt and dry Fomentations were applied to the affected part; but theſe proving ineffectual, the Patients Pulſe gradually diminiſhing, he died the fourth day after this laſt invaſion of his Diſtemper.</p>
                  <p>His Carkaſs being opened, the great Gut <hi>Ileon</hi> was found to be infected with a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene the length of a Span, and ſited in the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> with flatulent and hard Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59518:87"/>Friends of my Patient not too much to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond, and to that end related to them the Eighth <hi>Obſervation</hi> communicated to <hi>Rive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Ozia Aimar</hi> a moſt famous <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon</hi> of <hi>Gratianopolis,</hi> in which after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Remedies for nine days uſed in vain, the Bowel (for as many days) remaining in the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> was happily repoſited by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion made, as far as to the production of the <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> which ſtranguled the Bowel. The method by which this Operation was inſtituted, you will find in the above-cited <hi>Obſervation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whence is it that in an <hi>Hernia</hi> the Bowel ſlips down into the <hi>Scrotum</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parts? This is occaſioned by relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> which proceeds from Obſtruction of the many ſmall paſſages of the ſame, and becauſe in them the Humors ſtagnize and are coacervated, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time inſinuate themſelves between the Fibrils of the <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> and ſo relax the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Now why did not the Bowel, fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Scrotum</hi> of our Patient, with as much eaſe return into the <hi>Abdomen</hi> as it came out, ſeeing the way is the ſame? This principally hapned becauſe the Bowel had remained ſo long out of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> in the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> where was leſs heat: For the Pores of the Bowel, by that means ſomewhat conſtringed, prevented the free egreſs of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59518:88"/>the Vapours (partly alſo condenſed by the Bowels long lying in the <hi>Scrotum</hi>) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were coacervated in the Bowel, and diſtended it with <hi>Flatuſes</hi> as they are commonly called.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is hence ſufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that the principal Cure of this Evil conſiſted in opening the Pores of the Bowel (fallen out of the Belly) and rendring the Vapours (in ſome meaſure condenſed) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain fit for greater motion and agitation, that ſo they might circulate (as formerly) round their proper Centers.</p>
                  <p>I effected this with <hi>Thread</hi> newly twiſted (and not purged by boiling) which I firſt boiled in ſweet Milk, and then applied it hot to the affected part; by which means, after it had been applied one quarter of an hour, the Bowel (with gentle force of the Hand) returned into the <hi>Abdomen</hi> of the Patient, laid in a fit poſture.</p>
                  <p>The Sick man, thus (as it were) ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Jaws of Death, with the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher learned to be wiſer, and afterwards always wore an Iron Truſs (all over co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Cotten) for retaining the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el in its place: For, to attempt to heal men perfectly that are ſo far in years, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with this Evil, is to labour in vain. What <hi>Fabritius Hildanus</hi> relates (in his Book of <hi>Obſervations</hi>) very rarely happens, <hi>viz.</hi> That a man Sixty years of age, had for
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59518:88"/>Twenty years been afflicted with a great <hi>Hernia,</hi> which could not be healed by any Phyſician or Chyrurgeon, and that the ſame old man afterward was intirely reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his priſtine health, without Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, after he, afflicted with ſome perillous Diſeaſe, had lain upon his Back 14 days; therefore the ſame Author affirms Reſt and lying on the Back to be the beſt Remedy againſt the <hi>Hernia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we ſee the <hi>Hernia's</hi> of young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren very often cured (and indeed eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the Eighth year of their Age) with a good Truſs made of Linnen, and <hi>Sylvius</hi> his <hi>Carminative Plaiſter</hi> ſpread upon Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (the Diſcription of which is found in the firſt Book of his <hi>Praxis,</hi> Chap. 14. under the Title 58.) in which notwithſtanding there is one Errour which I hope no man will follow, worthy to be noted, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Gum Galbanum</hi> and other things are diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Vinegar, which not a little infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Volatile Salt of them.</p>
                  <p>The Oath of Phyſicians in the <hi>Ultraje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctine Academy</hi> commands, that things heard or ſeen in a Cure ſhould not be mentioned but involved in ſilence. And this Oath (I judge) ſhould be ſtrictly obſerved in the <hi>Hernia's</hi> of Young men; becauſe this Evil attending them is wont to be more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to Maidens than is fit; which (before I finiſh this <hi>Obſervation</hi>) I purpoſe to declare by an Example.</p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:59518:89"/>
                  <p>A new-married Virgin, when ſhe and her Bridegroom were the firſt time in Bed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, boldly handled thoſe parts of her Husband which <hi>Adam</hi> (as the Scripture witneſſeth) preſently after his Fall, covered with Fig-leaves; and ſo by the Truſs he wore, perceived he was afflicted with an <hi>Hernia;</hi> whence ſhe, driven almoſt to madneſs, paſſionately uttered theſe words: <hi>You may be aſhamed ſo impiouſly to deceive your</hi> Lover; <hi>O miſerable wretch that I am, what Counſel ſhall I take? I am certainly undone. Can ſuch a diſtempered Body ſatisfie a Maid in the flower of her Age, having not as yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed her eighteenth year? No, I am to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally loſt, and had rather die than live longer with you.</hi> The Husband in the mean while ſeriouſly pondering the matter, at length with kind and good words returned her this Anſwer: <hi>My Love, my Sweet-heart, be of good cheer, and drive from thee this vain and ſuperfluous care; for I promiſe you by the effect to prove my ſelf a Man ſufficient, ſo that you ſhall never afterward have cauſe any more to complain of this matter.</hi> Nine Months were ſcarcely elapſed, before Experience confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Husbands words, by Twins which his Wife was delivered of; who never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter durſt ſo much as whiſper any thing of her Husbands imaginary impotency.</p>

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59518:90"/>hardneſs; and ſo this Tumor was healed in the ſpace of a few days.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not at this time explain how the Impoſthume was produced, <hi>Pus</hi> generated, the Ulcer cleanſed, and many other things of which I treated above; but onely ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that I here (contrary to the vulgar cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom) uſed no Tents, and for good reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they, in many caſes like this of ours, do commonly infer more detriment than eaſe or benefit; for they are wont by their pungent property to hurt the Bottom of the Ulcer, and render the Lips of the ſame callous; and in the mean while can do no good, becauſe the <hi>Pus</hi> is very often found happily enough to iſſue out without their help.</p>
                  <p>Not onely in this <hi>Impoſthume;</hi> but alſo in many others, I have obſerved, in the firſt days after the apertion of the Tumor, a white ſhining <hi>Pus</hi> to flow out; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a certain pellucid, yellowiſh, oyly and ſomewhat viſcous Juice, at the ſight of which (being taught by frequent experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) I have been accuſtomed to judge the Evil would in a ſhort time be healed; and that they do egregiouſly err (whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they be) that ſeeing this above-deſcribed Juice, would keep open <hi>Impoſthumes</hi> by thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in Tents.</p>
                  <p>Now that you may more eaſily give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to what is here mentioned, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59518:90"/>by ſolid Reaſon to confirm this Experience. The iſſuing out of a white ſhining <hi>Pus,</hi> for ſeveral days, from an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen <hi>Impoſthume,</hi> is cauſed by an acid Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (with which the Interiour Superficies of the <hi>Impoſthume</hi> is imbibed) mixed with the nutritive Juice, by reaſon of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted paſſages, falling into the Cavity of the Tumor: but when this acid Ferment is removed, then the nutritive Humor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelf ſincere to the ſight, <hi>viz.</hi> pellucid, yellowiſh, oyly, and ſomewhat viſcous.</p>
                  <p>That this oyly Liquor, at firſt pellucid, acquires a white colour (by its admixion with Acidity) will undoubtedly ſeem ſtrange to no man that hath even but once in his life ſeen how ſoon <hi>Oyl-Olive,</hi> after it hath been mixed with <hi>Vinegar,</hi> preſents it ſelf white to the ſight.</p>

                  <p>A Matron giving ſuck one very cold Night, expoſing her left Breaſt (as ſhe lay in Bed) to the then freezing Air,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59518:91"/>the next day complained of a great Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor (of the ſame Breaſt) hard and very painful, which continually increaſed: Some days were elapſed before my Advice was asked.</p>
                  <p>This Tumor was twice a day anointed with unſalted Butter mixt with common Chalk, and over all was applied hot a ſmall Bag filled with <hi>Rye-flover;</hi> and in the mean while for ſeveral days the Patient ſuckled her Infant.

                  <p>By reaſon of Cold admitted, the Milk ſtagnized in certain Glandules, was coacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and waxed acid; whence, as may be eaſily judged, that hardneſs and dolour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived their Original.</p>

                  <p>How far <hi>Chalk</hi> is available for correcting acid Humors, you may eaſily diſcern, when you mix the ſame in a Glaſs with <hi>Vinegar,</hi> becauſe immediately after the commixion of both, you ſhall ſee and hear an egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and very manifeſt (although as to our touch cold) Efferveſcency, and afterwards you will find the ſharpneſs of the <hi>Vinegar</hi> not a little diminiſhed.</p>

                  <p>A Maid, aged Forty years, had now for ſix Weeks paſſed, complained of a moſt vehement dolour, yet not far exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but exerciſing its Tyranny in a very ſmall part of the Belly, and day and night moſt cruelly tormenting the Patient, who had uſed very many Remedies, both Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and External: She was purged, and had a Vein opened, but in vain; ſo that (after the uſe of theſe) ſhe almoſt deſpared of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering her priſtine Sanity; in the mean while the External <hi>Cutis</hi> in the pained part, could not be diſtinguiſhed from the ſound parts of her Belly.</p>
                  <p>I, being called, with my Knife cut a ſmall Wound, which is vulgarly called an Iſſue, and kept that open by a Pea put in and daily renewed.</p>
                  <p>The next day after the cutting that Iſſue, the Patient had eaſe of her pain, which from day to day did more and more leſſen, ſo that it was wholly removed quickly after.</p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:59518:92"/>
                  <p>One Month after the Iſſue made I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it again to cloſe up, and ſo this ſick Maid was in a ſhort ſpace of time freed from this exceeding Torment and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well.</p>
                  <p>Some Acido-corroſive Particles in the affected part, were perhaps ſeparated from the other Particles of the ſanguiferous Maſs, with which ſo long as they lay involved they could not exerciſe their ſharpneſs.</p>

                  <p>Theſe Acido-corroſive Particles, freed from their Cells, in which they before lay included, and collected in a very ſmall part of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> did with their ſharpneſs in a wonderful manner continually agitate the Fibrils, and ſo inferred that almoſt intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable torment, which muſt neceſſarily ceaſe when theſe corroſive Particles were driven out with the <hi>Pus</hi> through the Iſſue.</p>

                     <p>Of an exceeding great Dolour of the Ear.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Virgin aged Twenty four years had now for 15 Weeks very much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of an almoſt intolerable pain of her Ear, which ſometimes would, whole nights, hinder her ſleep; the Ear in the mean while daily poured out abundance of well digeſted <hi>Pus,</hi> many Medicaments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adhibited in vain.</p>
                  <p>I being called, gave heed to all (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the leaſt) Circumſtances as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly as I could, and at length with my
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59518:94"/>Fingers felt a certain Undulation of <hi>Pus,</hi> deeply ſited behind the affected Ear. This Abſceſs was not obſerved by others, though it was the cauſe of the whole Evil.</p>
                  <p>Well weighing and conſidering the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſoon underſtood, that this Abſceſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Ear would never ſpontaneouſly, <hi>viz.</hi> without external Artifice, be opened; not onely by reaſon of its depth, but alſo becauſe the <hi>Pus</hi> there contained had already ſought an Exit for it ſelf by the Ear, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that paſſage was full of crooked turnings, and not ſufficient. Wherefore I quickly applied a ſufficiently ſharp Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, by which the Eſchar being ſeparated, an abundance of well-digeſted <hi>Pus</hi> iſſued out by the hole made by Art; and after that time the dolour of the Ear and the out-flowing of <hi>Pus</hi> from the Cavity of the ſame wholly ceaſed. The hole made by the Corroſive (all the <hi>Pus</hi> being by it eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated) in the ſpace of two Weeks wholly cloſed up, and the Sick Maid was perfectly reſtored to her priſtine ſtate of health.</p>
                  <p>I judged this Aperture behind the Ear was to be made without delay, leſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Pus</hi> ſhould have touched the ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Bone, and in time have infected the ſame with rottenneſs, although good <hi>Pus,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding for ſome time upon a Bone doth not always neceſſarily infect the ſame with rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs, as I ſhall eaſily demonſtrate by the following Example.</p>

                  <p>A Man about the Thirty ſixth year of his age, travelling in very ſtormy Weather in the Winter-time, ſoon after felt a great pain in his right Ear, out of which every day after ſome <hi>Pus</hi> iſſued out, and then followed no ſmall abatement of that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Afterward the <hi>Pus</hi> flowing out no more, the Sick man again complained of very great torture, which (in the night often producing a <hi>Dilirium</hi>) had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now for ſeveral Months, and yielded to no external or internal Remedies.</p>
                  <p>Being called, I found a Tumor behind the Ear extended far and wide, in which (I firmly perſwaded my ſelf) <hi>Pus</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, although (by reaſon of the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the place in which the <hi>Pus</hi> lay hid) no Undulation could be perceived by the touch; therefore I applied a Corroſive, by which a very groſs Eſchar being ſeparated, an incredible quantity of <hi>Pus</hi> iſſued out. This <hi>Pus</hi> lay upon the <hi>Petroſe Bone,</hi> which was wholly bare, as I could eaſily obſerve by my Probe: Yet in the mean while, without any ſeparation of Fragments of the Bone, the Patient (in the ſpace of ſix Weeks) was perfectly healed, and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well afterward; no other Medicaments being uſed, than a fit <hi>Injection,</hi> a good <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive,</hi> and at length (the Bone being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain covered) my <hi>Tincture of Antimony,</hi> which I daily find wonderfully profitable in many caſes externally uſed.</p>

                  <p>The Drum of the Ear being eroded by an Ulcer, the Hearing is recorded to have remained, by <hi>Vopiſcus Fortunatus Plempius,</hi> in his <hi>Fundamentals of Medicine,</hi> page 148.</p>
                  <p>Moreover I remember I have at <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> (with <hi>Jacob Lodenſteyn,</hi> chief Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of the Navy, a moſt dexterous man) ſeen all the ſmall Bones, pertinent to Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which after an Ulcer, came out of the Ear of a certain Boy; but that Boy never heard of the ſame Ear afterwards.</p>
                  <p>I knew a Chirurgeon, who to remove the pain of the Teeth, was wont with a red-hot-Iron to burn the Ear; but this ſeems to be a ridiculous and vain operation.</p>

                     <p>Of the Cubit diſplaced by reaſon of Relaxation of the Ligaments.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Youth about 15 years of age, one even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing putting off his Clothes, ſuddenly and unexpectedly felt Immobility of his arm, with a certain ſound ariſing therefrom, becauſe the Cubit was diſlocated, which was eaſily again repoſited; but very often afterwards, upon the leaſt motion it would
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59518:95"/>ſlip out of its place. This Evil had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for full three years, notwithſtanding all the deceits of <hi>Apoſems,</hi> made of <hi>Guaia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, Sarſaparilla, China,</hi> and other things which the Patient (animated by the hopes of health) had during this time greedily ſwallowed; in the mean while <hi>Plaiſters, Liniments,</hi> and other External Remedies, were not omitted: but the Youths Arm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came much more ſlender than was fit.</p>
                  <p>The Patient at length committed himſelf to a certain Chirurgeon to be cured, who certainly promiſed him the reſtoration of his Arm, which he ſet about after the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner.</p>
                  <p>To the Arm ill-affected, he (every week often) applied certain <hi>Cupping-glaſſes,</hi> but without Scarification; and then the ſame days after Cupping, under the Arm (the upper part of which was covered) he bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> impregnated with the Volatile Salt of many Herbs, the Vapour of which ſurrounded the whole Arm. Theſe were the principal things, which (in the ſpace of half a year) reſtored to our Young man his priſtine ſtate of health; ſo that the Patient at this time, without fear of a relapſe, pleaſeth himſelf with the Art of <hi>Fencing,</hi> and other like Exerciſe.</p>
                  <p>The Ligaments connexing the Gubit with the Shoulder, were relaxed; how that hapned you may ſee, in the laſt <hi>Obſervation</hi> of the Firſt <hi>Decade.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:59518:96"/>
                  <p>Beſides, there were many Obſtructions in the Nerves, Arteries, and ſmall paſſages of the Muſcles, whence proceeded the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophia and extenuation of the Arm.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cupping-glaſſes,</hi> often applied with Flame, removed the Obſtructions of the Ligaments, Muſcles, and other parts; by their heat opening the Pores and ſmall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and giving more free paſſage to the Circulation of the Bloud and Humors through the Arm: For the preſſure of the Air under <hi>Cupping-glaſſes</hi> is much leſs and weaker than elſewhere; as you may more clearly underſtand by the 7th <hi>Obſervation</hi> of the Third <hi>Decade.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Vapours of the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> kindled into a Flame, did (without any impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) enter into the Pores and ſmall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, ſufficiently opened by the <hi>Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſes,</hi> and there atenuated and diſſolved the viſcous and coagulated Humors.</p>
                  <p>And ſo thoſe Particles (that had inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated themſelves between the Fibrils of the Ligaments, and by that means relaxed them) being removed, the Ligaments acquired their priſtine ſtate which they before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, whilſt the <hi>Arm</hi> remained unhurt, and by that means they again retained the Cubit conjoyned with the Shoulder, as was fit.</p>
                  <p>The remaining Obſtructions being alſo removed, the Atrophia of the Arm did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe begin to vaniſh.</p>

                     <p>Of a Gonorrhaea contracted from impure Contact.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Young man aged Twenty four years, a great admirer of Beauties, and a true Son of <hi>Venus,</hi> after Coition with an impure Harlot, ſuffered an almoſt continual Iſſue of white and viſcous matter from his Yard; which was not onely without plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but alſo attended with a cutting do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which was likewiſe felt when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient voided his Urine.</p>
                  <p>An Acido-corroſive Ferment lying hid in the Genital-parts of this Whore, being more than uſually agitated in Coition, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the Yard of this Young man, into the Pores of the Proſtates and ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Veſſels (by Coition more than uſually opened) and ſo by its ſharpneſs infected both the Seed and nutritious Humors, and excited ſmall Ulcers in thoſe parts: Hence aroſe that Vellication and almoſt continual contraction of the Proſtates and ſmall Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Veſſels in the aforeſaid manner, with dolour frequently pouring out the Seed and nutritious Humors corrupted.</p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:59518:97"/>
                  <p>This Evil is generally called a <hi>Gonorrhaea,</hi> and is ſufficiently perillous, becauſe it often degenerated into the <hi>Venereal Lues</hi> if the Cure of the ſame be deferred: For then the <hi>Acido-corroſive Ferment</hi> is forcibly remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and mixed with the Sanguineous Maſs.</p>
                  <p>Therefore without delay I ſet about the Cure, and (for temperating and evacuating the corroſive Acidity, as well as for ſana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſmall Ulcers) I preſcribed the following Pills.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>℞. <hi>Extractum Catholicum,</hi> granes 24.</item>

                  <p>Make Pills, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> vii. Theſe Pills the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient took early in a Morning, and for five days following (every day once) he took this Bolus.</p>

                  <p>He again afterward uſed the above-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Purgation and Bolus as before; and by this means recovered this priſtine ſtate of health.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Turpentine</hi> is, by ſome, ſo long boiled, as until Pills may thereof be made, but this is an evil practice; for the boyling forceth the Spirituous Oyl into the Air, whereas in that Oyl the principal vertues of the <hi>Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> is known to conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>I do again condemn Acid things in this
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59518:97"/>Affect; but perhaps my Opinion will ſeem ſtrange to ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> that Acidity ſhould be ſo noxious and inimical to Sanity in a living Animal, whereas <hi>Vinegar</hi> preſerves the fleſh of a Beaſt killed, for a long ſpace of time without corrupting; but, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this Scruple, I Anſwer: The matter is far otherwiſe in a living Animal than it is in the ſame when dead.</p>
                  <p>In a living Animal, for conſervation of Life and Health, the free Circulation of Bloud and Humors (through the Veſſels and paſſages ſufficiently opened) is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary; yet this Circulation is not a little impeded by <hi>Vinegar</hi> and other acid things coagulating the Bloud and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. But in a dead Animal, to preſerve the Fleſh thereof, the aforeſaid Circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not requiſite; but there is onely need to take care that the very ſmall Particles of the Fleſh killed be not too much agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, fermented, and forced from their ſtation by the ambient Air: to effect this, <hi>Vinegar</hi> is very fit by reaſon of its groſs and heave Particles.</p>
                  <p>That the fleſh of a Beaſt killed will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main uncorrupted, if the motion of the very ſmall Particles (otherwiſe like to be) be by this or that cauſe ſtopped, is very manifeſt by this, <hi>viz.</hi> that Fleſh killed in Winter is kept ſound for many days; whereas the Fleſh of a Beaſt (of the ſame
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59518:98"/>kind) killed in the heat of Summer, is moſt ſpeedily corrupted by the Air, at that time conſtituted in very ſwift moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Vinegar</hi> conſiſts of groſs and heavy Particles, is manifeſt by <hi>Diſtillation,</hi> which teacheth, that <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> is ſooner eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the alembeck than Water, and Water alſo ſooner than Vinegar.</p>
                  <p>Moreover it may be ſaid, that the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt of Fleſh killed is coagulated with <hi>Vinegar,</hi> and ſo is kept unmoved, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded from being fermented with the Air, loſing its Figure, and flying away; as we ſee the Volatile Salt of <hi>Hartſhorn,</hi> or any other Volatile Salt, coagulated with an acid Spirit, not to fly away, as it is otherwiſe wont to do.</p>

                     <p>Of a Wound of the Head.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Youth aged Sixteen years, fallen from an Horſe to the ground, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſufficiently large Wound in the forepart of his Head; which was indeed ſo great, that the Bone preſented it ſelf bare to the ſight; in the mean while the Patient did often vomit and was very ill. Two hours, after this miſhap, were ſcarcely elapſed, before I was called to this Youth, in whoſe Head I could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive neither Fiſſure, nor Fracture, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowing of the <hi>Cranium;</hi> and at that time the Vomiting ceaſed, and the ſick Youth was pretty ſedate, and complained not much of pain or of any other diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
                  <p>It would in this place be ſuperfluous to explain whence this Vomiting proceeded; the matter being (as I judge) ſufficiently clear of it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Hair being ſhaved off, I filled the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59518:99"/>Wound with dry Lint; and indeed did this for two reaſons: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the Flux of Bloud might by this means be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the Lips of the Wound might be in ſome meaſure ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted each from other, to the end that the <hi>Cranium</hi> might (the next day) be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>Then I ſuperpoſited a Plaiſter made of the following Maſs.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>℞. <hi>Emplaſt. Diapalma,</hi> ℥ij.</item>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Mix and make a Plaiſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next day nothing of evil appeared in the <hi>Cranium</hi> diſcovered, and the Patient was ſcarcely vexed with an evil Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome; whence I conceived hope, that the Interior part of the <hi>Cranium</hi> had alſo received no hurt, and that the Brain like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe lay unprejudiced within both its Infol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, the Bone being firſt covered with dry ſcraped Lint, I applied to the Lips of the Wound this following Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>℞. <hi>Common Turpentine,</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Honey of Roſes, of each</hi> ℥ſſ.</item>

                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mix theſe, make an Unguent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:59518:99"/>
                  <p>By this means the Patient was in a ſhort time reſtored to his priſtine ſtate of health.</p>
                  <p>The Plaiſter was applied for tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Acidity, and that it might ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſolve whatſoever was coagulated by the Contuſion: The <hi>Unguent</hi> was alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for reſtoring the Circulation of the Bloud and Humors, ſomewhat impeded by reaſon of the ſmall paſſages (in the Wound) interrupted and diſtorted.</p>
                  <p>The bared <hi>Cranium</hi> was covered with dry ſcraped Lint, partly that the <hi>Pus</hi> (iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing from the Lips of the Wound) might infer no damage to the Bone, and partly that the ambient Air might (by this means) be kept from the <hi>Cranium,</hi> to which, by reaſon of its Acidity (with which it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds) it is very inimical, as the daily coagulation of Bloud let out from a Vein cut (cauſed by the external Air) doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teach.</p>
                  <p>But that kind of Lint which is in <hi>Dutch</hi> called <hi>Catoen,</hi> is not convenient in Wounds, becauſe it is often wont, by its acute Angles (with which it abounds, as by the help of a <hi>Microſcope</hi> may eaſily be ſeen) to excite Inflammation.</p>
                  <p>All fat things I here ſtudiouſly avoided, becauſe they, with their ſtringy Particles, too pertinaciouſly obſtruct the very ſmall paſſages of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> and ſo cauſe the Humors to ſtagnize and wax acid, corrupt
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59518:100"/>the Volatile Salt of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce rottenneſs; and then the Cure muſt needs be not a little procraſtinated, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the periſhed part of the Bone, which muſt firſt be ſeparated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scultetus,</hi> in his <hi>Chyrurgick Armoury,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noints the part adjoyning to a Wound with aſtringent Oyls (for ſome time) to prevent Inflammation (as he judgeth) but improperly: For in an Inflammation the Circulation of the Bloud ſhould not be ſtopped, but promoted; becauſe the Bloud and Humors, by reaſon of their coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in an Inflammation ſtagnize more than is fit; therefore it would in this caſe be an Argument of much greater pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to diſſolve the coagulated Humors by Plaiſters temperating Acidity.</p>
                  <p>The cutting of a Vein, which many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregiouſly extol in Wounds of the Head, I wholly omit, becauſe I ſee not any Utility thence to ariſe.</p>
                  <p>To diſtinguiſh <hi>Medicaments,</hi> into <hi>Mundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatives</hi> and <hi>Narcoticks,</hi> and to take ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Theſe, and afterwards Thoſe into uſe, is a matter of no Utility; for our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent onely is ſufficient, and performs what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is neceſſary; whilſt it temperates Acidity, and reſtores the Circulation of the Humors. But in the mean while it is to be obſerved, that when the Wound was almoſt filled up with fleſh, omitting the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59518:100"/>Unguent, we at length applied dry ſcraped Lint; for otherwiſe the Fleſh would have been too luxuriant and riſen higher than was fit.</p>
                  <p>The Ancients in Wounds of the Head u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Swathe which is called <hi>Cancer,</hi> the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neation of which may be ſeen in <hi>Scultetus;</hi> but in theſe our days a common Napkin fitly applied is generally uſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vomiting,</hi> in a Wound of the Head, for the moſt part portends much evil; but that it is not always an infallible ſign of a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the <hi>Cranium</hi> of a <hi>Fiſſure,</hi> or any other very great diſcommodity, is clearly evident by our propoſed caſe.</p>
                  <p>Full of peril is a Wound of the Head, which beguiles us moſt when it ſeems moſt pleaſing. Therefore no Wound of the Head (though very ſmall) ſhould be light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed, or negligently handled; but here we ſhould rather ſuſpect all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe where <hi>Chyrurgeons</hi> are moſt ſecure, there commonly lies a Snake in the Graſs.</p>
                  <p>Having for ſome time pondered theſe things in my mind, I judge it worth while before I put an end to this <hi>Obſervation,</hi> to enlarge my Diſcourſe more than I am wont to do, that if (in this caſe) I cannot ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie others, I may at leaſt give ſatisfaction to my ſelf, for whoſe Inſtruction I write theſe.</p>
                  <p>It is out of all doubt, that a very ſmall
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59518:101"/>Wound of the Head, long after it hath been inflicted, may infer Death; yet this hinders not, but that it may ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that a Patient having a Wound of his Head (accounted almoſt by all men moſt dangerous and mortal) may recover, contrary to the expectation of <hi>Phyſicians</hi> and <hi>Chyrurgeons.</hi> So, I remember, ſome years ſince, to my Fathers care was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a certain wounded man, who had with a Spade received ſo horrid a Wound in the forepart of his Head, that (by the ſtroke inflicted) not onely a very great part of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> but alſo no ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Brain it ſelf was ſhattered, and notwithſtanding this, the ſame man is at this time (at <hi>Arenacum</hi>) living and well, yet his <hi>Hemiplegia</hi> ſtill remains.</p>
                  <p>By this Hiſtory I ſhall (perhaps) prove the opinion of the moſt famous <hi>Willis</hi> to be falſe, who endeavours to perſwade his Reader, that the ſeat of the Memory is found to be in the Cortex of the Brain; for if this were true, then our above-recited Patient muſt needs have had his Memory much impaired, whereas it is at this time no leſs vigorous than it was before the Wound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p>But what do I ſpeak of thoſe who have recovered of an horrid Wound of the Head? Is it not much more wonderful, that to ſome perſons very great benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59518:101"/>from a Wound of the Head ſo very perilous, that it is by moſt men accounted mortal? eſpecially ſeeing there want not Examples teſtifying the ſame? So you may read (in <hi>Schenkius</hi>) how a certain man, receiving a dangerous Wound in his Head, was freed from an inveterate and very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacious <hi>Epilepſie.</hi> Alſo if it be not too much trouble to you, I would have you peruſe the moſt famous <hi>Hildanus</hi> (in his Second Century, <hi>Obſervation</hi> VIII.) who expoſeth to ſight a caſe ſufficiently rare; where he ſaith, A certain man received a Fracture of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> upon the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Sagital,</hi> with the <hi>Coronal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and the ſame man afterward (the Ulcer notwithſtanding remaining) was by this means freed from a great and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <hi>Cephalalgy,</hi> with which he had been for a long time before) very much mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted.</p>
                  <p>Such Hiſtories as we have now related, very rarely happen, therefore in a Wound of the Head (whatſoever it be) it is beſt to be always too careful, rather than at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time too ſecure.</p>
                  <p>But a Wound of the Head, where the Patient is infected with the <hi>Veneral Lues,</hi> is much more difficultly healed; as alſo if the ſame part hath been often wounded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For uſually in the <hi>Lues</hi> an Acido-cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive Humor is peccant, which contributes
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59518:102"/>no ſmall Impediment to the cure of Wounds. But when it happens that the ſame part hath been often wounded, it is well known, that not a few of the ſmall paſſages there remain diſtorted in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manner; ſo that the Bloud and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are thereby not a little impeded in their Circular Motion, by the benefit of which (notwithſtanding) almoſt the whole cure of Wounds is effected.</p>
                  <p>That the Circulation of the Bloud and Humors is impeded in a part once or oftner wounded, though the Wound be long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore healed, is manifeſt by this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the parts formerly wounded are frequently ſenſible of the approach of Cold or Storms more than uſual.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, a Wound of the Head is more or leſs dangerous according to this or that part of the Head on which it is infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: So a Wound of the hinder-part of the Head is judged leſs perilous, becauſe the Bone of that part (by reaſon of its groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſolidity) ſeldom ſuffers a Fracture or Fiſſure, although it receive a ſtroke very vehement; and when it doth happen to be broken or crack, then the Filth notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (in this Fracture or Fiſſure col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected) doth not ſo eaſily diſtil down upon the ſubjected hard <hi>Meninges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But a Wound inflicted on that ſmall Bone of the <hi>Brain,</hi> with which maturity of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59518:102"/>Age afterward fills up the open place in Infants, is accounted, and undoubtedly is, very perilous, becauſe that Bone is tender and nigh the <hi>Suturos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So a wound of the Temples is very formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable for many Cauſes; and indeed firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Temporal Muſcle is covered with the <hi>Pericranium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe there lies an Artery (ſufficiently great) which being wounded induceth a very dangerous <hi>Hoemorrhagia,</hi> which muſt needs be very difficultly ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; becauſe while we ſpeak or eat the Temporal Muſcles are moved, and ſo the flux of Bloud (before cohibited) is often wont to return and be renewed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> becauſe the Nerve (in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Muſcle) hurt is wont to excite a <hi>Spaſmus,</hi> and indeed ſuch as in <hi>Dutch</hi> is called <hi>de klem,</hi> and hinders the Patients eating. So when a Muſcle of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples is very much hurt, its oppoſite Muſcle is contracted, and that Affect excited, which is called Torture (or Wryneſs) of the Mouth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> becauſe Artificial Section (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times neceſſary in Wounds of the Head) cannot be ſafely made in a Temporal Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> becauſe the cure of Wounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires reſt of the wounded part, which notwithſtanding is often diſturbed in a
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59518:103"/>Wound of a Temporal Muſcle, <hi>viz.</hi> as oft as we eat or ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>A Fiſſure in <hi>Sutures</hi> is alſo worſe than elſewhere, and moſt difficultly found. So <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (Epid. 5.) freely. confeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have been deceived, and indeed to the ruine of the wounded man.</p>
                  <p>A Wound inflicted on the Eye-brow, ſo as the Cavity be opened, which is found in the Bone of the Forehead, emits wind, becauſe that Cavity of the Bone is previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous into the Noethrils; that Wound can ſcarcely (by any means) be conſolidated, according to the teſtimony of <hi>Celſus</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that have ſeen ſuch caſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chyrurgeons,</hi> when they doubt of a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture or Fiſſure of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> give to the wounded man a Nut to crack with his Teeth; or they make a Thred (one end of which the Patient holds in his mouth) obſerving whether he can bear that trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling motion without trouble.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Cranium</hi> is bared, we general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a Probe ſearch whether there be a Fiſſure or no. But that this Examen may be rightly inſtituted, 'tis behooful before all things exactly to know the accuſtomed ſite of <hi>Sutures;</hi> leaſt a Fiſſure be taken for the <hi>Suture,</hi> or the <hi>Suture</hi> it ſelf for a Fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Alſo, that this Errour may be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhunned, it is expedient for the Artiſt always to bear in mind, that the <hi>Sagittal</hi>
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:59518:103"/>
                     <hi>Suture</hi> doth ſometimes (contrary to the uſual cuſtom) ſlip down as far as the Noſe, and ſo deforms the Forehead; yea, alſo that it ſometimes extends it ſelf to the hinder-part of the Head and divides that. Here likewiſe the Obſervation of a certain Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſt is worthy of remarque, who affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth he ſaw that little Bone of the <hi>Breg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> with which (in riper age) the place lying open in young Children, is filled up to be circumſcribed with a ſmall <hi>Suture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Writings of <hi>Parey, Fallopius,</hi> and others, we may read of wounded men, in who (being dead and opened) the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Table of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Wound, was diſcerned to be intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whole, the Internal (in the mean while) not onely cleft, but alſo exhibiting certain Fragments, which (by their punction) mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted the <hi>Meninges.</hi> How could this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen? I anſwer: The vehement ſtroke had very much agitated the <hi>Subtile</hi> matter near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and ſo this Subtile Matter moſt ſwiftly moved (without delay) freely paſſed through the firſt Table of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring no damage; but when it came to the ſecond Table of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> much more ſolid than the firſt (as <hi>Anatomiſts</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie) it there met with Pores ſo very ſmall and crooked, that it could not paſs unleſs by a new way, which it in a moments time violently prepared for it ſelf; and ſo
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59518:104"/>(many Pores being broken through) egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly cleft the Internal Table of the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium:</hi> As Lightning is reported to have melted a Sword leaving the Scabbard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt; ſo <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> diſſolves <hi>Silver,</hi> not hurting <hi>Wax.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many declare that it ſometimes happens, that the right-ſide of the forepart of the head being ſtruck, the left-ſide is crackt, the right-ſide remaining whole; and ſuch a Caſe is uſually called a <hi>Contrafiſſure,</hi> though this word <hi>Contrafiſſure</hi> is often extended to other caſes alſo.</p>
                  <p>I willingly confeſs I never ſaw ſuch a <hi>Contrafiſſure;</hi> but <hi>Celſus</hi> affirms ſuch a caſe hath happened, <hi>Aegineta</hi> denies it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſuſpend my judgment about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>It ſo happens ſometimes, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which is found between both Tables of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> is (by a forcible ſtroke) cruſhed and ſqueezed out which the Bloud (alſo by the ſame force) extravaſate: and ſo this Marrow with the Bloud conceives an Acido-corroſive <hi>Acor,</hi> by which it indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth rottenneſs on the Internal Table of the <hi>Cranium;</hi> and ſo (ſometimes) the acrid and aqueous Humor, proceeding from the periſhed Bone, infects the <hi>Meninges</hi> and Brain it ſelf, and infers ſudden and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Death, ſome Weeks, yea ſome Months after the hurt received; the <hi>Cranium</hi> in the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59518:104"/>mean while on the out-ſide appearing whole, not ſhewing either Fracture or Fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuren Such Examples are here and there deſcribed by Author that have written of Chirurgy.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cranium,</hi> with the <hi>Dura-mater,</hi> being hurt, ſometimes (in the ſpace of 24 hours) ariſeth a <hi>Fungus,</hi> in magnitude almoſt as large as an <hi>Hens-Egg,</hi> which the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Malpighius</hi> judgeth to derive its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from thoſe <hi>Glandules</hi> hurt, of which the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the <hi>Cerebrum</hi> is compounded, and which (according to his Opinion) end in the Roots of the Nerves, into which they tranſmit their nervous Juice received from and purified by the Arteries.</p>
                  <p>It is by almoſt all Authors ſeriouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, that no Wounds of the Head be ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and indeed very well.</p>
                  <p>When Wounds of the Head were bound up, <hi>Veſalius</hi> always uſed a Wax-candle ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (not a Suet-candle, becauſe fatneſs hurts the Bones) to the end it might in ſome meaſure temperate the cold of the ambient Air; but at this time ſome Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons uſe a certain Braſs Veſſel filled with live Coals, which Veſſel is in <hi>Dutch</hi> called <hi>een bedpan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The middle ſpace, that is between both Tables of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> is found to be much thinner in Children, than in Men full grown; which is (as I judge) very fit to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59518:105"/>be well obſerved by Chyrurgeons when they either uſe a Trepan or Lancets; for otherwiſe it may happen that they may perſwade themſelves they are not yet come to the middle ſpace, when in the mean time they hurt the <hi>Meninges</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Some, before they uſe the Trepan, chuſe to make a croſs-like Inciſion of the Fleſh; others a Triangular; but my Father al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways eſteemed the Circular Inciſion beſt, and ſo he ſeparated and took away all that portion of fleſh from the <hi>Cranium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Operating ſome dip their Trepan in Oyl for temperating the heat, (as they ſay) but evily, becauſe Oyl, as we have often ſaid, is inimical to the Bones; wherefore common Water may in this caſe better ſerve.</p>
                  <p>The Ancients opinionated, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Brain in Animals increaſed in the firſt Quarters of the Moon; therefore at the Full Moon they forbid the uſe of a Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan. But at this time Experience hath taught, that the Brain in the <hi>Cranium,</hi> and the Marrow in the Bones of Animals, do no more abound in the Increaſe of the Moon than at any other time; thus this Opinion, ſuperſtructed on ſo ſandy a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, falls to ruine.</p>
                  <p>The Ancients would not permit the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan to be put in <hi>Sutures;</hi> but we have <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons</hi> at this time who do this without fear.</p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:59518:105"/>
                  <p>It ſometimes happens, that the <hi>Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mater</hi> very firmly adheres to the <hi>Cranium;</hi> yet this is but ſeldom, and is beſide the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Meninges</hi> lying bare, <hi>Scultetus</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies <hi>Oyl of Roſes, Celſus</hi> Vinegar; both err, the one more, the other leſs. What can Oyl effect, unleſs it be the obſtruction of the Pores and Paſſages of that membrane, and ſo impede the Circulation of the Bloud and Humors? But Vinegar will coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Bloud and Humors, circulating through the <hi>Meninges,</hi> and ſo not a little hinder the circular motion of them.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall then be here applied? <hi>Honey</hi> or <hi>Syrup of Roſes;</hi> but beſt is the <hi>Syrup,</hi> (being leſs ſharp) which may be put in hot with a round Lint, having a Thred tyed thereunto.</p>
                  <p>The Trepan being uſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it ſometimes happens, that no Evil is found upon the <hi>Meninx,</hi> but the <hi>Pus</hi> lies hid under the ſame: When this is ſeen, the <hi>Meninx</hi> muſt be cut, that paſſage may be made for the <hi>Pus</hi> to flow out. Here is no cauſe of fear, that the <hi>Pia-mater</hi> will be hurt, becauſe the interjacent <hi>Pus</hi> prevents that. I remember that this Apertion of the <hi>Meninx</hi> was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily inſtituted at <hi>Arenacum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Patient wounded in the Head, ſhould rather aſſume Meats liquid than ſolid. For otherwiſe the motion of chewing may
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59518:106"/>ſomewhat moleſt the wounded part; and indeed more eſpecially if the Wound be inflicted in the Temples.</p>
                  <p>If Sneezing ſieze any one wounded in the Head, it will undoubtedly too much ſhake his Brain and hurt the Wound. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would be prudence ſo ſoon as Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutation is perceived to approach to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſame; which may eaſily be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, if at that time we often rub the greater Angle of either Eye with our Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
                  <p>In a Wound of the Head, Anger and Venery muſt (above all things) be ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe they very much diſturb the Brain, and ſo infer no ſmall damage to the miſerable Patients; as frequent Experience daily proves.</p>
                  <p>Thus I ſhall now at length put an end to this <hi>Obſervation,</hi> after I have ſaid, that here I have offered none but thing rare and worthy of note. For all other things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to Wounds of the Head, are largely enough treated of by <hi>Parey, Hildanus, Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetus,</hi> and other writers of Chirurgy, which to repeat here (I judge) would be wholly needleſs.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>A Young man Thirty years of age, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Wound between the ſixth and ſeventh Rib (if you reekon from the inferiour) with a Sword, which penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Cavity of the Breaſt, as was experienced by a Probe gently thruſt in; as alſo by the Air, impetuouſly enough iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from the Wound. The Patient in the mean while eat well and complained little.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe this Wound was not ſufficiently opened to give Exit to the <hi>Pus,</hi> we put in a Tent (made of Spunge) with a Thred tyed to it, and by this means the Wound was the next day very well opened.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Wound, thus handled for ſeveral days, emitted a little <hi>Pus,</hi> and the Patient was otherwiſe very well; therefore we dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly formed the Tents ſhorter, and ſo the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient was (in ſix Weeks time) wholly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of this Wound.</p>
                  <p>The Probe, with which the deepneſs of the Wound was ſearched, was not Iron; becauſe this Metal (by reaſon of its rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) doth not ſufficiently give way to the Muſcles, which are wont ſometimes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and fill up the place of the Wound, when the Patient changeth the poſture of his Body; but a Wax-candle (in <hi>Dutch</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>een waſſichie</hi>) was uſed, which in this caſe, by reaſon of its flexibility, would better ſerve. But before we ſet about this work, we commanded the Patient to ſtand
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59518:107"/>with his Body in the ſame poſture in which he ſtood when wounded.</p>
                  <p>The Air brake forth impetuouſly enough from this Wound, and ſometimes ſo forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as it would blow out a Candle held near. But whence did this happen? I Anſwer, When the <hi>Thorax</hi> is ſtreightned in Expiration by the Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> as alſo by its proper Muſcles, the Air (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt with not a few Vapours) is compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and compelled to ſeek for it ſelf an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it; and ſo, by reaſon of the ſtreightneſs of the place, it is with great force driven out from the Wound, no otherwiſe than as we ſee Air with great impetuouſneſs to iſſue out of the Noſe of Bellows, when the ſides of the Bellows are only gently compreſſed. For ſo a great part of the motion; which before did diverſly agitate the ſeveral Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Air, is now imployed to move the Air to one part only.</p>
                  <p>But why was the Tent tied with a Thred? I anſwer; That it might not be forced into the Cavity of the Breaſt. For that ſuch a thing hath ſometimes hapned, very many Hiſtories teſtifie; yea, we have read, that Tents have not only been forced into the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> but alſo that the ſame afterward hath been by the Mouth of the Patient expelled with coughing.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, whence is it that the Tent
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59518:108"/>ſometimes penetrates into the Cavity of the Breaſt? Shall we with the Ancients anſwer, that is done by Suction or indraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Thorax?</hi> No: For we can clearly and evidently enough demonſtrate that every motion conſpicuous in this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Univerſe is made by Pulſion.</p>
                  <p>It would be no leſs abſurd and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to Reaſon, if I, with many others, ſhould in this place have recourſe to the <hi>Aſylus</hi> of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> which is not, as is clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer than the Sun at Noon, to all thoſe that are not wholly blinded with their own Prejudices; and is diſtinctly enough ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by the famous <hi>Carteſius,</hi> in his Second Part <hi>of the Principles of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that we may call this what it is, and what may moſt eaſily be underſtood, we reply in this manner: When the time of Inſpiration is preſent, the <hi>Thorax</hi> is rendred more capacious, becauſe the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is contracted downward. Now becauſe the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is thus contracted, the Belly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregiouſly ſwells, and ſo forcibly enough drives out the Air, which (there being no where any Vacuum) at the ſame moment of time muſt needs enter the <hi>Thorax</hi> enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as aforeſaid; and ſo the Air enters partly through the Cleft of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> partly alſo through the Orifice of the Wound, (as being a paſſage more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59518:108"/>more ſhort, and more free) and when the Air ſo ruſheth inward through the open wound of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> in its paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through it forceth the Tent in with it ſelf, it be not tyed with a Thred ſtrong enough.</p>
                  <p>Some Authors, when they ſuſpect that ſome part of the Bloud or <hi>Pus</hi> doth lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> they endeavour to heal up penetrating wounds of the Breaſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of any Tents, and commend the ſame to others; but in the firſt days they cannot be ſufficiently aſſured of this matter: therefore they ſeem to act more prudently, who (with me) for ſome days uſe Tents, and in the mean while as much as they can keep the ambient Air from the Wound. But in the interim we muſt be very careful in due time to abſtain from Tents: For if their uſe be protracted lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than is fit, an uncurable Fiſtula may happen, continuing to the laſt moment of life; becauſe the continual agitation of the Breaſt in Reſpiration (which is no ſmall hindrance to the Conſolidation of Wounds) is not a little conducent to the production of ſuch an Evil.</p>
                  <p>Penetrating wounds of the <hi>Thorax</hi> are very dangerous, and compel many to bid adieu to the Society of the Living, and in others excite a <hi>Ptiſick</hi> worſe than death it ſelf. But in the mean while, I remember
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59518:109"/>I have read of one, who was happily freed from an <hi>Aſthma</hi> (with which he was long before cruelly afflicted) by a wound penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax.</hi> Yea, I at this time know an honeſt Citizen of <hi>Arn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemium,</hi> to whom a penetrating wound of the Breaſt proved very ſalutery. For he for a long time before had been afflicted with an <hi>Empyema,</hi> and daily expected death: but when by another (I know not from what cauſe provoked) he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a Sword, ſo as the Wound pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated into the Cavity of the Breaſt; and by this means, the <hi>Pus</hi> flowing freely out through the Orifice of the Wound, he was in a ſhort time after freed from his <hi>Empye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> my Father (while he lived) being his Phyſician.</p>
                  <p>When, in a very ſmall Wound of the Breaſt, Chyrurgeons doubt whether the Wound hath penetrated into the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax</hi> or not, they are wont to hold near to the Wound either burning Tow, or the flame of a lighted Candle, and thence they judge of the penetration of the wound; if there be a Trembling motion in the flame of the Tow or Candle, excited by the Air proceeding from the Breaſt, then the Wound is deep, otherwiſe not.</p>
                  <p>When it happens that any part (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Cavity of the Breaſt) is alſo hurt, then the Wound muſt be kept open
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59518:109"/>the longer, and into it twice a day ſome Injection be emitted hot, without the addition of <hi>Carduus Benedictus, Aloes, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> and other bitter things, as ſome are wont to add. For the bitter Particles car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried upwards with the Air, through the Branches of the Pipe of the Lungs hurt, affect the Tongue with bitter and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome taſte, as frequent Experience wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth.</p>
                  <p>If any great ſanguiferous Veſſel (ſited in the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax</hi>) be wounded, then much Bloud is wont to be collected together above the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and (by this means) to excite heavineſs about the <hi>Diaphragma, Fevers, Watchings, bloudy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, proſtrated Appetite, and difficult Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Bloud muſt be ſeveral times every day evacuated through the Orifice of the Wound; yea the <hi>Pus</hi> alſo, which ſome days after the Wound received uſually fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                  <p>If the Bloud that flows out from a ſign the Lungs are wounded; and ſuch a Wound often infers on the ſick a <hi>Tabes,</hi> but more often death. This will not ſeem ſtrange to any man, who (with <hi>Malpighius</hi> and other curious ſearchers of the Humane Body) will not diſdain ſomewhat more piercingly (than the Ancients have done)
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59518:110"/>to inſpect the ſubſtance of the Lungs. So doing, he will diſcern the Lungs to be no other than a certain conjeſted heap of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous ſmall Bladders, clothed with a wonderful Net (compoſed of the minute very ſmall Branches of the ſmall Veins and Arteries) into which ſmall Bladders paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is given to the Air through the rough <hi>Artery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence therefore it is ſufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that a Wound of the Lungs cannot be ſo very ſmall, but that ſome ſmall ſanguiferous Veſſels of theſe ſmall Bladders muſt alſo be hurt; whence the Cure is rendred yet more difficult (which was before of it ſelf diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult enough) becauſe theſe ſmall Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are membranous, and poſited in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual motion, into which every hour new Air is introduced. For membranous parts are more ſlowly healed than the fleſhy; and no man can doubt, that reſt of the part hurt haſtens the conſolidation of a Wound, if he hath (but once in his life) obſerved how eaſily wounds of the <hi>Tibia</hi> are healed, the ſick keeping himſelf in a Lying-poſture; and on the contrary, how difficulty the ſame wounds are conſolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when the Patient daily walks about the Streets. And laſtly, who knows not that the ambient Air ought diligently to be kept from Wounds?</p>
                  <p>Therefore wounds of the Lungs (as we
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59518:110"/>ſaid) are by Experience found to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all mortal. Yet in the mean while we read, that a Patient may ſupervive the taking away a piece of his Lungs by a Wound.</p>
                  <p>Aſſoon as men are born and reſpire the Lungs are filled with Air; but it is not ſo in the Young whilſt in the <hi>Womb.</hi> To this Phyſicians give heed, when they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the Magiſtrate to give their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion whether an Infant died in the <hi>Womb,</hi> or loſt its Life out of the <hi>Womb.</hi> For then they take the Lungs out of the Breaſt of the Carkaſs and put them into water; if they ſwim above the water, they conclude the Infant died out of the <hi>Womb;</hi> but the contrary when they ſink and are ſubmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
                  <p>A Wound in the fleſhy part of the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma,</hi> brings the ſick into no ſmall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril, yet that is ſometimes healed. But when a membranous part of the <hi>Diaphrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> is wounded, the Patient (a <hi>Fever</hi> and <hi>Delirium</hi> ariſing) expires not long after. Nor indeed is this to be wondred at, ſeeing (by reaſon of the continual and very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible motion of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi>) the ſmall paſſages about the Wound are very much diſtorted; whence the Humors there ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing wax acid and produce Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And when theſe acid Humors are (from the Inflamed part) abſorbed into
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59518:111"/>the ſanguineous maſs, a Fever is induced, which a <hi>Delirium</hi> follows. So I remember a Carter of <hi>Arnhemium,</hi> who was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a Knife in the membranous part of the <hi>Diaphragma.</hi> Preſently after the wound inflicted he came to our houſe on foot; but ſoon after became ſo very weak, that he was carried home by two men, where (ſiezed with a <hi>Fever</hi> and <hi>Delirium</hi>) he died three days after.</p>
                  <p>But wonderful is that which I not long ſince read, <hi>viz.</hi> that in one man the Stomach, in another the Gut <hi>Colon</hi> (by a wound of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi>) aſcended from the <hi>Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> into the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and that both Patients lived for ſome ſmall time after.</p>
                  <p>A wound of the <hi>Pericardium</hi> is judged mortal; and where the ſubſtance of the Heart is alſo wounded, the Patient (for the moſt part) ſuddenly dies. Yet I am able truly to witneſs, that a Jew of <hi>Arnhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium,</hi> wounded in the very ſubſtance of his Heart, did notwithſtanding (every day twice) for ſix days together (before he died) come to our houſe on foot to have his Wound dreſſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galen</hi> in one place relates (as an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs) that the <hi>Pericardium</hi> being corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Heart lay ſufficiently bared in the Breaſt of a certain ſick Man, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding recovered. But men at this day are found to be ſo very incredulous, that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59518:111"/>with them ſuch Hiſtories find, or ſeem to deſerve, little credit.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt I make mention of the Heart, two Prejudices ſeem to me fit to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The firſt is, <hi>that</hi> with which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the Common ſort are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected; that is, they pertinaciouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Heart hath its ſeat in the Left-ſide of the Breaſt, whereas it is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the midſt of the Breaſt. But occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Errour was firſt given to the people from this, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe there is a more vehement Pulſe felt in the Left-ſide of the <hi>Thorax</hi> than in the Right. But this happens becauſe the great Artery hath its ſituation in the Left-ſide.</p>
                  <p>The other prejudice, which I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to reprehend, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſome of the <hi>Ancients</hi> did perſwade themſelves that the Heart was afflicted with no Diſeaſes; the falſity of which Opinion is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding daily proved by Experience. So in the French <hi>Ephimerides</hi> we read, that (in the right Ventricle of a Dogs-Heart) thirty and one living Worms were found, being of the length of one Finger, and as thick as a common ſmall Needle. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the Heart is ſometimes affected with a certain Diſeaſe, called the <hi>Polypus of the Heart;</hi> touching which, peruſe <hi>Malpighius</hi> in his <hi>Anatomick Treatiſe</hi> of the <hi>Structure of the Bowels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:59518:112"/>
                  <p>In penetrating wounds of the Bowels, ſome Chyrurgeons inſtead of Tents uſe ſmall Cannels of Silver, Lead, or of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen well waxed; but becauſe Silver is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten infected by the <hi>Pus,</hi> and Lead too ſoon covers the Lips of the wound with a <hi>Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice,</hi> here in this place the Cannais made of Linnen well waxed ought to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the other.</p>
                  <p>Acid things are inimical to all Wounds, but eſpecially to wounds penetrating the <hi>Thorax:</hi> For beſides their coagulating the Bloud and Humors, and rendring them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt for <hi>Circulation,</hi> they do alſo hurt in this caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe with their Acid-Particles cutting on either ſide, they are wont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a cough.</p>
                  <p>But although I reject acid things, I do not therefore here commend ſweet Syrups, ſeeing they profit the Lungs little, but (in the mean white) hurt the Stomach and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts; as many others with my ſelf do daily find by Experience. It is better from <hi>Colts-foot, Maiden-hair,</hi> and other fit Herbs, to extract their Tincture with boyling hot Water in ſuch a ſmall Veſſel as the now commonly known Drink is wont to be prepared of the Herb <hi>Tee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a Patient be afflicted with a penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wound of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and the Bloud, latent in the Cavity of the Breaſt, iſſue not out by the wound, let him hold one Graine
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59518:112"/>of Musk under his Tongue, and the Bloud will preſently flow out, as <hi>Sennertus</hi> ſaith; but of the ſucceſs I very much doubt.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the place of the Breaſt woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded is higher than that the Bloud or <hi>Pus,</hi> congeſted upon the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> can flow out; then is the Bloud or <hi>Pus</hi> not ſeldom ſeen to be expelled by the Mouth with coughing; yea, not a few Authors teſtifie, that at ſuch a time the <hi>Pus</hi> is ſometimes driven into the Bladder, and expelled with the Urine; which <hi>Pus</hi> (they think) may by two ways be brought to the Bladder: Firſt, if through the ſmall Veins or Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick Veſſels, it be forced into the ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Maſs, and with the ſame carried to the Reins; and at length (when it ſhall there be tranſcolated) deſcends by the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reters into the <hi>Bladder,</hi> and ſo is expelled with the Urine. But the other way ſeems to be far more difficult: For they judge that the <hi>Pus</hi> can, in the form of Dew, tranſpire through the Pores of the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma</hi> (from within looking outward) and ſo paſſing through the whole <hi>Abdomen,</hi> at length enter the Cavity of the Bladder through the Pores of the ſame (from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looking inward.) That ſuch Pores, from without looking inward, may be found, is evident by the following Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: In an hot Room invert a Bladder, and fill it with hot Water, and then you
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59518:113"/>will ſee the Water tranſpire like Dew.</p>
                  <p>When it happens that the <hi>Pus</hi> (copiouſly contained upon the <hi>Diaphragma</hi>) cannot be expelled by the wounds being too highly ſited, nor by the Mouth with coughing, nor be evacuated by the Bladder with the Urine, then is commended a <hi>Paracentheſis;</hi> that is, an Artificial Inciſion in a lower place of the <hi>Thorax.</hi> This Inciſion is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually made between the fifth and ſixth Rib (if you number from the Inferiour) not in the midſt of the Breaſt, but in the Side; and this rather in the Anterior than in the Poſterior part thereof; and rather about the Superiour than the Inferiour part of the Rib; and indeed with a Knife, having (for a good part of it) a Cloath wrapped round about, juſt at that moment of time in which the Patient breaths.</p>
                  <p>But in this Age wherein we now live, and in theſe Regions, this operation is very rarely exerciſed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Paracentheſis</hi> being made, the <hi>Pus</hi> muſt not be let out all together and at once, but at ſeveral times. This all Chyrurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concede to, but few of them know why they do ſo. Some ſay the Spirits would be diſſipated if the <hi>Pus</hi> ſhould be let all out at one time; others feign, that provident Nature is then ſenſible of that Vacuum, therefore preſently ſends much, yea too much Bloud and Humors into that
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59518:113"/>place. But both theſe Reaſons are ſo very frivolous, that they deſerve no refutation. Therefore I ſhall briefly declare what I judge to be the reaſon of this: It is certain that into that place, from which the hot <hi>Pus</hi> hath receded, the cold Air hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate acceſs; which doth not only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the Fibrils (before ſomewhat injured by the <hi>Pus</hi>) but alſo produceth many Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in the ſmall paſſages; ſo that in them the Humors ſtagnize, are coacerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wax acid, and by that means an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation is excited, much after the ſame manner as when we have been expoſed to the cold Air, and preſently after are well warmed, we are not ſeldom afflicted with Catarrhs (as they are vulgarly called) and when we are above meaſure hot, and at that time drink cold Beer, we are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times puniſhed with a Pleuriſie.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of a penetrating Wound of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Young man, aged Twenty years, was wounded by an Adverſary of his, ſo
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59518:114"/>that the Sword paſſed through the anterior part of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> and pierced through his Back.</p>
                  <p>The Patient ſoon after he was wounded took his Bed, and the firſt days did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what complain of this or that Diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; but afterwards from day to day he waxed better and better; and both his Wounds (in three weeks ſpace) were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly conſolidated with the uſe of Tents put in, which were firſt anointed with a good Digeſtive, and a fit Plaiſter ſuperpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited.</p>
                  <p>It was not neceſſary in this caſe to ſearch into the profoundity of the Wound, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficiently manifeſt, that this Wound had penetrated into the Cavity of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen,</hi> becauſe the Swords point had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the Belly and came forth at the Back.</p>
                  <p>Otherwiſe the profundity of a Wound is wont to be ſearched out by an Iron or Leaden Probe; but better is a Wax-candle (which is in <hi>Dutch</hi> called <hi>een Waſlichie</hi>) becauſe it can much more commodiouſly be bowed, and accommodated to all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Meanders.</hi> Here in the mean while it is to be ſtudiouſly obſerved, that ſometimes the Probe enters very deep, paſſing through the <hi>Interſtitiums</hi> of the Muſcles, and the Wound (notwithſtanding) penetrates not ſo far as into the Cavity of the Belly.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59518:114"/>And on the contrary the Wound ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times penetrates into the Cavity of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen,</hi> though the Probe (when thruſt in) preſently finds reſiſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the parts in the Body hurt were otherwiſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured when the ſick was wounded, than afterward when the ſtate of the Wound was ſearched into.</p>
                  <p>A Wound of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> though it penetrate not into the Cavity of the Belly, yet is difficultly healed, by reaſon of the motion of Reſpiration: For Wounds to be conſolidated require Reſt.</p>
                  <p>But if a Wound of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> not penetrating, be in the <hi>White-Line</hi> (ſo called) then it is much more difficultly healed, and very painful.</p>
                  <p>In the Second <hi>Obſervation</hi> of this <hi>Decade,</hi> I willed the enlargement of very ſmall wounds of the Breaſt; but this Operation deſerves not place in wounds of the <hi>Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi> For in ſuch it is to be feared that the <hi>Omentum</hi> of Bowel, through too large an hole of the Belly, ſhould ſlip out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the <hi>Abdomen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some dream, that the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the Dead ſhall take beginning from the ſmall Bone contained in the 18th <hi>Vertebra;</hi> but they dream indeed without any ſimilitude of Truth. Truly I know not what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer men of ſuch an Opinion would give me, if I ſhould ask them, whether that man
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59518:115"/>ſhould not riſe in whom that ſmall Bone had (while he lived) been broken to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by a Wound.</p>
                  <p>The Teſticles hang without the Cavity of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and therefore may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily wounded; yet their being wounded hazards not the life of the Patient. For we by experience find, that a man can ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervive the cutting out of both his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. I my ſelf familiarly knew a man (ſtudious of Medicine) who had both his Stones by reaſon of a <hi>carnous Hernia</hi> happily cut off.</p>
                  <p>What then are the Teſticles? They are no other than a certain Congeſture of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many moſt ſmall Threds or Veſſels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the Seed; which Threds, if ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated each from other without breaking, would (in a man) eaſily exceed the length of twenty Ells. For the Teſticle of a <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſe</hi> is extended to fifteen Ells.</p>
                  <p>Many Chyrurgeons, to Wounds do firſt of all apply repelling things, that is things cold and aſtringent; but in wounds of the Groin omit them. If you ask their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they will anſwer you, Becauſe the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munctory</hi> of the Liver is in the Groin. This Anſwer is both frivolous and rediculous, and we have already (in the Eighth <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of the Firſt <hi>Decade</hi>) exploded and and ſufficiently refuted the ſame.</p>
                  <p>What then is the reaſon that Chyrurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59518:115"/>do any where elſe but in the Groins uſe cold and aſtringent things? Attend a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and I will tell you. Cold and aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent things hurt almoſt every where, but more in the Groins than elſewhere; which <hi>Experience</hi> (the Miſtreſs of Fools) hath taught them. The fact they know and confeſs, but are wholly ignorant of the cauſe of ſuch an Effect. Therefore they ſeign to themſelves ſuch a <hi>Chymaera;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as (in the mean while) the true cauſe is, that certain <hi>Glandules</hi> have their ſeat in the Groins, which <hi>Glandules</hi> are no other than a Congeſture of very ſmall Veſſels much inflexied, in the <hi>Meanders</hi> of which the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors more eaſily ſubſiſt than elſewhere, if Chyrurgeons (by cold and aſtringent things unſeaſonably applied) retard their Circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>All penetrating Wounds of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> are dangerous, but far more perilous when they are large; becauſe the <hi>Omentum</hi> (or Bowel) at that time eaſily ſlips out; and if it be not, preſently after its Egreſs, forced into its proper place, it dies and changeth its colour by reaſon of the ambient Air. But whence is it that the <hi>Omentum</hi> for ſome time remaining out of the Belly ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly dies? The <hi>Omentum</hi> conſiſts of very many ſmall Bags, into which the Greaſe is conveyed through ſeveral fatty Veſſels, as the moſt accurate <hi>Anatomiſts</hi> of this Age
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59518:116"/>plainly witneſs. Hence it is now eaſily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt how readily the Greaſe (in its ſmall Bags) and the Matter (contained in the very ſmall fatty Veſſels) may be coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the cold Air.</p>
                  <p>Now when the <hi>Omentum,</hi> iſſuing out of the Cavity of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> by reaſon of ſome delay, is in the aforeſaid manner cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; then muſt a Thred be tyed between the ſound and the corrupted part, and leaſt the ſound part alſo be infected what is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted muſt be cut off; and if the Wound be found too large, that muſt be ſewed up: but the aforeſaid Thread hanging out of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> muſt be a left ſo, until it falls off of it ſelf in proceſs of time. Thus I knew one, part of whoſe <hi>Omentum</hi> (by its too long ſtay out of the <hi>Abdomen</hi>) was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, recovered happily of his Wound, who was after the ſame manner handled by my Father.</p>
                  <p>In a large wound of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> the Bowel ſometimes iſſues, which muſt be preſently thruſt in; for otherwiſe it is ſo diſtended with <hi>Flatus's,</hi> as it cannot be thruſt into its priſtine place. But whence is it that the Bowel is ſo diſtended with <hi>Flatus's,</hi> remaining out of the Belly for ſome ſhort time? I anſwer; A certain Fermentation is excited, not onely in the <hi>Chyle, Pancreatick Juice,</hi> and <hi>Choler;</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the <hi>Feces</hi> left of the <hi>Chyle,</hi> and in the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59518:116"/>Ferment adhering to the ſides of the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. Hence ariſe many Vapours (not to mention thoſe Vapours which from the Pores of the ſmall Arteries, continually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Cavity of the Bowels) which muſt needs be accumulated in the Cavity of that Bowel, and diſtend it; if in the Bowel abiding out of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> the Pores (from within looking outwards) be cloſed up by the ambient Air.</p>
                  <p>Now what remains to be done, when the Bowel out of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> is ſeen di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended with <hi>Flatus's?</hi> The cloſed Pores are to be opened, and greater agitation contributed to the Vapours contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; which may well be effected, if a Thred newly twiſted, but not purged by boyling, having been firſt boyled in ſweet Milk, be applied hot.</p>
                  <p>Then the Bowel, the <hi>Flatus's</hi> being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, muſt be repoſited, and (if need be) the Wound, in ſome part ſewed up.</p>
                  <p>If the Bowels be alſo wounded, the life of the Patient is in very great danger; and indeed the more, if the Wound be infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in a thin Bowel, but not ſo if in a more groſs Bowel; becauſe in this the Wound, after it is ſewed up, is more eaſily conglutinated; the Bowel being ſuch as conſiſts of a greater number of ſmall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, through which the nouriſhing Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are conveighed. So the groſs Bowels
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59518:117"/>generally contain onely <hi>Feces,</hi> but Bowels more ſlender the <hi>Chyle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt I here treat of the Bowels, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Diſpute, which hath been for a long time contraverted among Phyſicians, comes into my mind, <hi>viz.</hi> whether nouriſhing Clyſters injected do obtain the wiſhed Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; or whether (as ſome ſay) they be wholly unprofitable for Nutrition; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, according to their opinion, they come not ſo far as to the ſanguineous Maſs? But they err who embrace the laſt opinion, if credit may be given to credible men, who (taught by Experience) witneſs, that the ſame quantity of <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected into the Fundament by a Clyſter, will ſooner inebriate than if taken in by the Mouth.</p>
                  <p>The Liver conſiſts of certain glandulous Kernels, into which the ſmall ſanguiferous Veſſels conveying their own Humor, are terminated, and of the Branches of the Bilary-Pores, which receive the Choler ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated in thoſe glandulous Kernels.</p>
                  <p>Moreover great ſanguiferous Veſſels are ſeen in the Liver, whence it is eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood how dangerous are thoſe Wounds that are inflicted on the Liver. For if the great Veſſels be opened, an <hi>Haemorrhagia</hi> yielding to no Remedies follows. And though thoſe great Veſſels be not hurt, yet a wound of the Liver (though but ſmall)
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59518:117"/>doth in the mean while diſturb the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Choler, which notwithſtanding we know to be exceeding neceſſary in the <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi> of an Animal.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding theſe, <hi>Paulus Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta</hi> ſpeaks of a man that recovered of a Wound that had taken away a piece of his Liver.</p>
                  <p>It is wonderful indeed, that one man ſhould ſupervive the loſs of a piece of his Liver, and another die by the too-great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his Liver. So ſome years ago, to my Fathers care was committed a Sick-man, afflicted with a vaſtly tumified Belly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſo unto Death. His Carkaſs being opened, clearly preſented the cauſe of this Evil to the ſight, for his Liver was incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly augmented. I remember the ſame hapned in an <hi>Hen,</hi> which never laid Egg, the Liver of which weighed an entire pound.</p>
                  <p>The Spleen is a congeſture of ſmall Membranes, formed into ſmall Cells and Concamerations, in which Cells innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable oval and white Glandules (into which the Arteries, Veins, and Nerves are opened) do in a wonderful manner adhere.</p>
                  <p>Here it is to be underſtood (as an induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Anatomiſt</hi> of this Age judgeth) that the Humor is carried, through the Arteries, into the Glandules of the Spleen, and by the Glandules (being there ſeparated and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59518:118"/>ſomewhat acid) into the above-named ſmall Cells; and from thoſe Cells, imbibed with an acid Ferment, into the <hi>Splenetic-Branch,</hi> and ſo to the Liver; where, in the Bloud, it in ſome ſort precipitates the Choler, to the end that may ſo much the more eaſily be ſeparated in the glandulous Kernels of the Liver.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is now manifeſt, what great miſery a Wound of the Spleen infers on the ſick.</p>
                  <p>The Reins conſiſts of Glandules, into which the ſmall Arteries, Veins, and Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Ureters, are terminated. Through the ſmall Arteries the Humour is deferred into the Glandules of the Reins, in which the Urine is ſeparated, and taken from the Branches of the Ureters is forced into the Bladder.</p>
                  <p>That the matter is thus, you will more eaſily believe, when you ſhall know the following Experiment, which a certain Profeſſor communicated to me, and is this: If you, by a Syringe, inject warm Milk into an emulgent Artery, the more groſs part will return by the emulgent Vein, and the wheyiſh Portion be ſequeſtred in the Reins, and thence conveyed into the Ureter.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is apparent how perilous Wounds of the Reins are, and how diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly they can be conſolidated; alſo
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59518:118"/>hence, whence proceeds Bloud excreted with the Urine, when the Reins are woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is eaſily underſtood.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt I am ſpeaking of the Reins, I call to mind a certain Queſtion often ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died about among Phyſicians, <hi>viz.</hi> which way the <hi>Drink,</hi> a little after it is aſſumed, caſt out by the Urinary paſſage, can come ſo ſoon into the Bladder? or whether it firſt comes to the ſanguineous Maſs, or not touching the Bloud, preſently and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately haſtens to the Reins or Bladder?</p>
                  <p>The latter ſeems more probable, and is confirmed by the following Experiment: If a Vein be cut in any one a little after he hath eaten <hi>Garlick</hi> or <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> neither the Bloud extracted, nor the whey-like Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour floating above it, ſhall have either the odour or taſte of the <hi>Garlick</hi> or <hi>Aſparagus</hi> eaten, when (in the mean while) the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine ſhall manifeſtly exhibit the odour of <hi>Garlick</hi> or of <hi>Aſparagus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, whether this Urine paſs out through the Pores (of the Stomach and Bowels) from within looking outward, and through the Pores of the Bladder (from without looking inward) under the form of Vapours, having ſurrounded the Cavity of the Belly, and ſo at length is conveyed to the Bladder, or rather hath its tendency thither by a peculiar paſſage, I ſhall not at this time diſpute, though the latter O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59518:119"/>ſeems to me moſt probable.</p>
                  <p>Wounds inflicted in the bottom of the Bladder are very full of danger; but thoſe that wound the fleſhy neck of the Bladder, are oftentimes conſolidated, by reaſon of the abundance of ſanguiferous Veſſels, and multitude of ſmall paſſages conveying the nutritious Humors. This is what we daily experience, after the exection of Stones, <hi>viz.</hi> that though thoſe wounds be healed, yet ſometimes the Urine flows from the ſick involuntarily by the Yard; the reaſon of this is, becauſe in Section and Extraction of Stones, not a few Fibres of the Spincter Muſcle of the Bladder are cut in ſunder and broken.</p>
                  <p>But if in the Cavity of the Belly, ſome of the ſmall Lymphatick Veſſels be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, may not an <hi>Aſcites</hi> be by this means produced? What ſhall I ſay? ſuch a caſe ſeems not to be impoſſible, though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remember that I have in my practice ſeen any ſuch thing, or elſewhere read of it.</p>
                  <p>Dolour of the Teſticles in perilous wounds of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> is a ſign of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching death, as the moſt experienced <hi>Parey</hi> teſtifies.</p>
                  <p>I have here hitherto ſpoken of wounds of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> inflicted from without, there is yet a Wound (remaining to be ſpoken of) which is inflicted from within, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:59518:119"/>as when in an <hi>Aſcites</hi> the Navel burſteth, partly from the great diſtention of Water, and partly from the acuteneſs of the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Particles floating upon that Water. So I remember an Hydropick Maiden-Child, aged five years, which (her Navel being after the aforeſaid manner burſt) dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a few days after.</p>
                  <p>In ſuch a diſruption of the Navel, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent heed is to be taken, that the Water flow not out too faſt; therefore here muſt be preſcribed an <hi>Apozem,</hi> prepared of <hi>Guai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acum, Sarſaparilla,</hi> and other things.</p>
                  <p>Some affirm, that if the <hi>Moon</hi> ſhine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a wound (whatſoever it be) that wound cannot be healed without difficulty; but whether this be true or no, I know not. It is certain, that the cold Air hurts wounds; but whether that be more injurious when the Moon ſhines than at any other time, is indeed what I have not as yet experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Blankard,</hi> in his <hi>Medico-Phyſical Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections,</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> mixt with <hi>Spirit of Sal-Armoniac,</hi> doth very much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in Wounds; and ſo ſaying doth not a little confirm my Opinion, whereby I judge Acidity hurtful in every wound, and that our principal care ought to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in correcting that.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of an Artery of the Arm woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Souldier Forty years of age, was wounded with the point of a Sword, in his Arm below the Cubit; from which wound the Bloud iſſued with great force, and indeed with intermediate ſtops, as if forced out of a Syringe by intervals.</p>
                  <p>That Artery was wounded which is touched when we feel the Pulſe of the ſick.</p>
                  <p>We have known Bleeding at the Noſe to kill ſome; and have read, that the haſty flowing out of Bloud, after Extraction of a Tooth, hath killed others. If the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch very ſmall Arteries can infer Death, into how great danger of life ſhall the Aperture of ſo great an Artery, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite the miſerably-wounded party?</p>
                  <p>Therefore, becauſe ſo great danger is ſited in delay, I judged the Cure was to be preſently ſet about, and accordingly (ſo ſoon as I came) I applied two Lints plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together croſs-wiſe a little above the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59518:120"/>wound, over them putting a ſufficiently ſtrict Ligature.</p>
                  <p>Then, to the wound, with Lint I applied the following Medicament mixt with the White of an Egg.</p>

                  <p>The Bloud thus ſtopping we did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bind the Wound before the third day; and then, from the Wound iſſued out a little <hi>Pus,</hi> but no Bloud. Thus was this wound (ſo very full of danger) with the help of a good Digeſtive, very well conſolidated, after the manner of other wounds, in two Months ſpace.</p>
                  <p>This Wound was very dangerous, but
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59518:121"/>would have been much more perilous, if it had been inflicted above the Cubit; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is found one onely great Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which (below the Cubit) is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two ſufficiently large Branches; ſo that one of them being cloſed by Art, the Bloud may freely paſs through the other.</p>
                  <p>It ſometimes happens, that the Bloud from an Artery wounded below the Cubit, running out with great force, cannot be ſtopped in the above-preſcribed manner; therefore at ſuch a time certain Iron-Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt be uſed, which I have always by me, though I cannot in words well give a plain Deſcription of them. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member two that were by this means cured by my Father.</p>
                  <p>So alſo, I have by me an Iron-Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; by the help of which my Patron (Conſul and Ordinary Phyſician of <hi>Steno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicum</hi>) as he told me, had happily ſtopped the Bloud flowing out from the Artery <hi>Carotides,</hi> in the Neck of a Fox woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, foraſmuch as wounds of the Arteries are ſo very dangerous (as we ſee) I thought good in this place to ſubjoyn a double caution. The firſt is, that we do not, after the manner of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> in dolour of the Head and other affects, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to uſe <hi>Arteriotomy</hi> about the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Forehead, or elſewhere. For greater
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59518:121"/>benefit from the opening of an Artery, than from the ſimple cutting of a Vein, is not to be expected. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Leaſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>Aneuriſma</hi> to be a vulgar <hi>Abſceſs,</hi> we unawares cut the dilated Artery. For by this means I have certainly known ſome to have augmented the number of the Dead.</p>
                  <p>Moreover Ligatures muſt not be tyed too cloſe; for by this means I remember a mortal <hi>Sphacelus</hi> hath unexpectedly been introduced.</p>
                  <p>But if the Patient from the wound of an Artery, loſe ſo much Bloud, as he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers great Swoonings, and Death ſeems to ſtand at the door, what is then to be done? Cannot the Transfuſion of Bloud (ſo much praiſed) in this caſe profit, eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is declared by credible men, that a Dog, from whom in one day ſo much Bloud was taken, that he could ſcarcely move, by Calves-Bloud received the next day, in a moment of time ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed recovery of ſtrength, and incredible vigour? I anſwer, I cannot remember this Operation to have been at any time inſtituted by our Country-men; therefore warily ſuſpended my, judgement about this matter.</p>

                  <p>Then was applied a digeſtive prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of <hi>Turpentine,</hi> the Yolk of an Egg, Powder of the Roots of <hi>Flower de Luce,</hi> and <hi>Birthwort,</hi> with <hi>Myrrh</hi> and other things, together with a Plaiſter and Lavament temperating Acidity. After theſe was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a common Ligature, and at length the affected Leg, included in a caſe of Wood, was aptly placed in the Bed; over which hung a Rope, by which the Patient might raiſe her body when neceſſity was; and at her Feet was erected a Semi-circle of Wood, leſt the weight of the Bed-clothes ſhould create any trouble to the wounded Leg.</p>
                  <p>The cutting of a Vein, which very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are wont to commend in ſuch a caſe, was wholly omitted; becauſe no benefit can thence ariſe; nor were Purgers here (according to the vulgar method) revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked into uſe, becauſe in this Evil nothing is more deſirable than Reſt, and nothing more pernitions than Motion. Therefore whenſoever the Patient was neceſſitated to diſcharge her Belly, a four-doubled
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59518:123"/>Cloath was laid under her to receive the Excrements.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while the Patient eat Foods eaſie of digeſtion, drank new Beer, and the firſt Evenings after ſhe was wounded, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a certain gentle <hi>Anodine,</hi> for miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the dolour and removing that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of which I ſpake.</p>
                  <p>The Bones were repoſited as often as they were found diſtorted by that Nocturnal terror.</p>
                  <p>The Wound by reaſon of great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Pus,</hi> was dreſſed twice a day; and ſo in proceſs of time very many Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ſeparated. And then we could daily ſee the Generation and Accretion of a <hi>Callus,</hi> ariſing not from the Marrow, but from the very ſmall Pores (or paſſages) of the Bone, through which are conveyed the nouriſhing Humors, coming from the ſmall Arteries.</p>
                  <p>This Wound, ſo very perilous, was clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up in a Months ſpace, and the Patient could again as well ſtand and walk as ſhe had done before this wound was inflicted.</p>
                  <p>I remember another Woman, afflicted with the ſame Evil, to have been cured by my Father. But theſe two Examples ſhould not render any Artiſt ſo ſecure, as ſlightly to regard a <hi>Fracture</hi> with a Wound: For I have known that to have cauſed death in many. So, when in the <hi>Hoſpital</hi> as <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:59518:123"/>I was preſent with others, daily for almoſt whole days, dreſſing very many wounded Men, which came from the Siege of the City of <hi>Graaf,</hi> I remember all they that laboured with a Fracture and Wound of the <hi>Tibia</hi> died; and among others, one was afflicted with a Fracture and wound of the <hi>Tibia,</hi> in whoſe wound I beheld (not without Admiration) very many broad, thick, and white ſhining Worms. But whence had theſe Worms their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal? I anſwer, From Eggs fallen from the Air into the wound, out of which the Worms were excluded, when a certain Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation was excited in the ſtagnizing Humors. So not a few Eggs fall from the Air into Milk, of which Cheeſe is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward made. As long as that Cheeſe is new, theſe Eggs are not excluded; but when the Cheeſe putrifies; that is, when (in proceſs of time) a certain Fermentation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the Cheeſe, then do the Worms crawl out of the Eggs.</p>
                  <p>So in a very great contrition of a Bone, the Fracture with the wound attending, I remember to have been cured no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by cutting off the Leg a little below the Knee.</p>
                  <p>In a Fracture of the <hi>Tibia</hi> with a wound, ſome are wont to uſe the Ligature of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Heads, which is in Dutch called <hi>een boexwiiſe <hi>Ligatuur;</hi>
                     </hi> but we have happily
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59518:124"/>uſed the common, which we changed twice a day by reaſon of the great quantity of out flowing <hi>Pus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I knew a Chyrurgeon, who inſtead of the wooden Caſe of which I ſpake, uſed a certain Iron-Inſtrument, into which the Leg affected was put, and ſo kept extended and unmovable but I cannot here in words give a deſcription of that Inſtrument.</p>
                  <p>In a ſimple Fracture of the <hi>Tibia,</hi> Feru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's made of <hi>Paſtboard</hi> are generally applied; but in our Patient theſe were wholly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe in a wound ſo vaſt they ſeemed not convenient.</p>
                  <p>With our Digeſtive, which was put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Wound, by reaſon of the bared Bone no Fatneſs was admixed. For that Fatneſs hurts the Bones, Experience doth abundantly teſtifie; the reaſon of which we have before given.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Parey</hi> in the <hi>Chyrurgick Practice</hi> was very deſerving, and had much Experience; yet in a Fracture with a Wound, he improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commends Aſtringents, which, why, and how much they hurt, we have often ſhewed. I ſuppoſe no man will take it in evil part that I ſhould dare to reprehend ſo great a Man; ſeeing the more famous any man is, the more dangerous are his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; becauſe very many, moved by the onely Authority of ſo great a Man, with a certain blind force follow him, treading a
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59518:124"/>Path that hath been trod, but not that which ſhould be trod.</p>
                  <p>It is to be obſerved, that a <hi>Callus</hi> is moſt difficultly produced in Fractures of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child, or giving Suck; becauſe the matter fit is withdrawn by the young in the Womb, or by the Infant ſucking. So <hi>Fabritius Hildanus</hi> relates (in the 87th <hi>Obſervation</hi> of his <hi>Fifth Century</hi>) that for this cauſe, in a Fracture of the <hi>Tibia</hi> with a wound, the Bones were yet looſe the 23d week after the hurt received.</p>
                  <p>In a Fracture, as well Simple as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, when a <hi>Callus</hi> hath again conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the broken Bone, the Patients are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſenſible of ſome trouble in motion; which happens becauſe the newly-genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Callus</hi> occupies the place of ſome Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles moving this or that part.</p>
                  <p>Before I put an end to this <hi>Obſervation,</hi> two very intricate <hi>Problems</hi> ſeem very fit to be here unfolded by me. The one is, why Bones in clear Froſty-weather are more eaſily and ſooner broken than at any other time? The other, whence proceeds the Terrour that generally invades the Sick (afflicted with a Simple or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Fracture) preſently after a ſhort ſleep.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some perhaps will anſwer, the ſlipperineſs of the Ice is the cauſe that men often fall to the Earth, and ſo the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59518:125"/>Bones may happen to be eaſily broken. But this doth not untye the Knot; this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves not the Difficulty: For not onely Bones, but alſo Iron, Wood, and other hard Bodies, are more eaſily broken in the Winter-ſeaſon than at any other time. Whence then doth this happen? Attend a while and I will tell you. The more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciouſly and firmly the parts of hard Bodies are conjoyned each with other, the more difficultly they are broken. This is certain: But what is that which effects co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herency in the parts of hard Bodies? Not Reſt, as ſome think, becauſe that is not any thing poſitive in the Body, but onely a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of motion. Therefore Reſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>produceth not this Effect; but the Air compreſſing the parts of hard Bodies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns and cauſeth them to cohere, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the Experiment cited in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth <hi>Obſervation</hi> of the Third <hi>Decade.</hi> The Air whilſt Summer's Heat is moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, preſſeth more than in Mid-winter; partly becauſe at that time it is more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly agitated by the heat of the Sun; partly becauſe then it is more heavy, by reaſon it is mixt with very many groſs Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, forced upwards by the Solar heat. Hence it is now manifeſt, why Bones, and other hard Bodies, are more eaſily broken in Winter than in Summer. Hence alſo it may readily be underſtood, why Wood is
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59518:125"/>much ſooner conſumed by burning in the extream cold Winter-ſeaſon, than whilſt we enjoy the pleaſant Summer. The Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Air, by its more weak preſſure, cannot very pertinaciouſly conjoyn the Particles of the Wood; whence theſe Particles are eaſily ſeparated from the Wood, when they ſuffer violence by certain terreſtrial Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; floating upon the onely moſt ſubtile matter of the World, therefore moſt ſwiftly agitated. Hence it is, that the Winter-Air, as being leſs preſſing and containing fewer Vapours, permits the Flame freely to enlarge it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>We now come to the other <hi>Problem,</hi> by which it is asked. Whence ariſeth <hi>Terrour,</hi> invading the ſick, ſuffering a Fracture of the Bone (in ſleep and not while waking) and often again diſtorting the broken Bones?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Parey,</hi> a man endowed with great Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in the <hi>Chyrurgic Art,</hi> who himſelf once ſuffered a Fracture of the <hi>Tibia</hi> and <hi>Fibula</hi> with a Wound, and in his own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy plainly enough experienced this Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as he ſaith; a reaſon of which he endeavours to render (in the 26th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Book of Fractures) but he there miſerably philoſophizeth, producing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Impertinencies and Chimoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, let us ſee whether we can
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59518:126"/>give a more probable Reaſon that may come nearer to the truth: We will at leaſt attempt it. When the Sick are not ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they ſee, they hear, they eat, they drink, and ſtir their Arms, and (by this means) conſume much of the Nervous Juice; ſo that that cannot flow in ſo great abundance into the parts irritated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but when the Sick indulge their Members with ſleep, the matter is far otherwiſe. The Ears at that time hear not, the Eyes are cloſed, the Noſethrils perform not their wonted Office, the Tongue is ſilent, and the Arms reſt. Therefore, when (at ſuch a time) the Humors ſtagnizing and wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acid about the Fracture, with their diſtention moleſt the Fibrils, and by their cutting property irritate them; then, I ſay, the Nervous Juice (which, in the time of the Patients waking, is not imployed) in great abundance falls down upon the irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Muſcles, which (by this means ſwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len) vehemently move the Leg, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably diſtort the Extremities of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Bone, one to this part, the other to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; whence ariſeth pain cruel enough, by which the Patient after a ſhort ſleep is awakened with terrour.</p>
                  <p>But that you may more readily give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the reaſon of this <hi>Phoenomenon,</hi> I judge it fit to adviſe you to attend to theſe few Words following.</p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:59518:126"/>
                  <p>When you are awake, and not ſleepy, and when your <hi>Semenary Veſſels</hi> contain much fruitful Seed, imagine to your ſelf (as ſtrongly as you can) ſome beautiful Maid, yet (as I judge) you ſhall not by this means eject your Seed, unleſs you uſe ſome other excitation: But if whilſt in a ſound and pleaſant ſleep, a very beautiful young Woman be (by imagination) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to your Phantaſie, and if (in the mean while) your <hi>Semenary Veſſels</hi> be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently diſtended with the Seed, the Seed not ſeldom (by ſuch means) flows out with very great pleaſure, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the <hi>Seminary Veſſels</hi> are very much contracted by the Nervous Juice, which in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance (whilſt you ſleep) is carried from the Brain into the <hi>Seminary Veſſels</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended and very much irritated by the Seed; becauſe it is not now imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout other works to be done whilſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
                  <p>So I knew two <hi>Epileptick Perſons,</hi> who never had Fit whilſt awake, but always when they ſoundly ſlept: which doth not a little confirm my Opinion.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of Diſlocation of the <hi>Talus,</hi> or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle-bone, with a Wound.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Man aged Forty years, fell from on high to the Ground, and ſuffered a Diſlocation (in the interior Ankle-bone of his Left-leg) conjoyned with a vaſt Wound, out of which the Bone was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent the breadth of three fingers, and the dolour was almoſt intolerable.</p>
                  <p>This caſe is very perilous: For, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great danger of life, a Gangrene ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times invades the great Toe, infected by the Diſlocation and Wound concomitant, as I remember not long ſince to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. But ſuch horrid Symptomes are not to be feared, if in the great Article of the <hi>Talus</hi> a Diſlocation alſo be with a very large Wound.</p>
                  <p>This Affect is not onely perilous, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo rare; ſo that <hi>Parey, Pigreus, Aquapendens, Barbette,</hi> and other ſcarcely ſo much as mention the ſame in their Books, although <hi>Scultetus</hi> (in his <hi>Chyrurgic Armory</hi>) ſpeaks of it: but whether credit is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59518:127"/>to his Words, or his Counſel follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we ſhall ſee, after we have pondered the following Words written by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>If an <hi>Article</hi> be luxuriant, ſo as it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uncovered, or be a little thruſt out through the Skin; the Affect is mortal, of greater danger if reſtored, than if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. For if it be not reſtored, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, Convulſion, or ſometimes Death follows. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Foulneſs <hi>of that</hi> Member <hi>will be preſent.</hi> And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> an uncurable Ulcer, which if it happen to be covered with a <hi>Cicatrice,</hi> that (by reaſon of ſoftneſs) is eaſily broken. If it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, it infers very great danger of a <hi>Convulſion, Gangrene,</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> But ſome fear dangers of this kind onely in the great <hi>Articles,</hi> viz. in the <hi>Wrist, Shoulder, Talus</hi> and <hi>Thigh,</hi> which (by reaſon of the ſtrength of the <hi>Tendons,</hi> and magnitude of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments</hi> and <hi>Veſſels</hi>) prohibit Reſtitution. Then he adds: If a <hi>Convulſion</hi> follows, the <hi>Joynt</hi> muſt be preſently again Diſloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>My purpoſe is no otherwiſe to anſwer theſe words of <hi>Scultetus,</hi> than by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and faithful Declaration of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines we applied to this our Patient; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby it will be ſufficiently manifeſt, how well or how ill the above-named Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath written.</p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:59518:128"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> We waſhed the Bone of the <hi>Tibia</hi> (forced out of its ſeat) with <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> warm, for removing the coagulated Bloud and Filths adhering; then ſufficient Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being made, we ſet the diſlocated Bone in its place, applying to the Wound a good Digeſtive, with a fit Plaiſter ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited; not omitting a Lavament tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Acidity, and a Common Ligature. The Leg thus bound up, was laid upon a ſoft Cuſhion, and ſo the Patient was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to his Bed, over which hung a Rope, by the help of which he could raiſe his Body, as I ſaid in the precendent Operation; and at the Feet of this Sick-man we ſet up a Board, that the Clothes (with their Weight) might infer no detriment to the wounded Leg.</p>
                  <p>The Leg affected, by reaſon of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of <hi>Pus</hi> (flowing out of the Wound) was dreſſed twice a day. But in the mean while moſt vehement dolour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed its Tyranny on our ſick Patient; who was both feveriſh, and had a <hi>Delirium,</hi> paſſing whole night (almoſt) without ſleep; or if he was between whiles, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what refreſhed with ſleep, a little after that was excited the aforeſaid Terrour (of which we ſpake in the precedent <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>) whence the <hi>Talus</hi> was often of ſome meaſure diſtorted again.</p>

                  <p>But the <hi>Talus,</hi> as often as it was found diſtorted after ſleep, was repoſited.</p>
                  <p>By this means, the ſpace of three Weeks being ſcarcely elapſed, the <hi>Fever</hi> and <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium</hi> ceaſed; then alſo, but more ſlowly, the aforeſaid Terrour vaniſhed, and at length the <hi>Dolour</hi> and <hi>Watchings</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                  <p>But here I call to mind one thing, which I had almoſt forgot, <hi>viz.</hi> that two <hi>Abſceſſes</hi> aroſe in the affected Leg, one nigh the Wound, the other in the External part of the Leg; but both theſe <hi>Abſceſſes</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Apertion were healed.</p>
                  <p>In proceſs of time very many Fragments were ſeparated from the Bone of the <hi>Tibia,</hi> which we then gently and eaſily took out of the Wound; and upon the fungous fleſh, which was ſeen in the Wound, we ſtrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (almoſt every day once) the <hi>Powder of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59518:129"/>Burnt Allum;</hi> and ſo at length a <hi>Cicatrice</hi> came in ſight, which from day to day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed more and more; ſo that (about the ſixth Month) the whole Wound was almoſt covered. Wherefore the Patient began to walk with Crutches; but by this motion the Wound was again inlarged, ſo that it cloſed not in every part, which ſhould ſeem ſtrange to no man. For I at this day know two, who after Diſlocation of the <hi>Talus</hi> with a Wound, had an Ulcer ſeveral years.</p>
                  <p>But what if (after ſetting the Diſloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Talus</hi>) the Patient had been afflicted with a Convulſion, muſt we needs have followed the counſel of <hi>Scultetus,</hi> and again have diſlocated the Article ſo lately ſet in its place? I think not, ſeeing I ſee no cauſe that ſhould incite us to ſuch an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>In this place I render not a Reaſon of many <hi>Phaenomenons,</hi> and indeed conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, leaſt I ſhould ſet before the Readers a Diſh of <hi>Crambe</hi> twice cookt.

                  <p>The coldneſs of the Air, both within and without affecting the Noſe, the Bloud (in its very ſmall Veſſels) and the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors (in their ſmall paſſages) were in ſome meaſure ſtagnized; and in proceſs of time contracted a certain <hi>Acor,</hi> whence the Tumor, Redneſs and Dolour, were eaſily excited.</p>
                  <p>But whence was it that this Evil had now ſeveral times returned in the Winter? This Return proceeded from no other cauſe, than becauſe the ſmall Veſſels and Paſſages were, the firſt time, ſo diſtorted, by the Bloud and Humors ſtagnizing and waxing acid, that afterwards they could never ſo well return to their priſtine ſtate,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59518:130"/>but they would (in Winter-time) much impede the Circulation of the Bloud and Humors.</p>
                  <p>This Affect (in <hi>Dutch</hi> called <hi>de Roud</hi>) is without danger, as to life; yet in the mean while it is not a little diſpleaſant to young Maids, accounting their own Form (whatſoever it is) as their chiefeſt good, and therefore are often willing rather to loſe their Life than their Beauty.</p>
                  <p>This Evil I wholly removed (in a few days) with a Linnen-Cloath onely, anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Sperma Ceti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall not now diſpute what that is which is known by the Name of <hi>Sperma Ceti;</hi> whether it be the Seed of that great Fiſh, or a certain Subſtance which is found (in the form of thick Oyl) in certain ſmall Cells in the Head of the Whale (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the largeneſs of <hi>Gooſe-Eggs;</hi>) or laſtly, whether it be a certain artificial Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Brain of ſome Fiſh dried, made up with a <hi>Lixivium</hi> of <hi>Lime.</hi> In this place I ſay, I will not diſpute of this matter; it ſufficeth me, that much Oyly Volatile Salt is contained in the aforeſaid Medicament, which corrects the Acidity in the bloud and ſtagnizing Humors.</p>
                  <p>This Evil is wont to invade not only the Tip of the Noſe, but alſo the Fingers, Toes, and Soles of the Feet. To attempt to render a Reaſon of this would be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59518:130"/>ſeeing it is manifeſt, that the cold Air doth more affect the Extreamities of the Body, than other parts; and ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are ſooner obſtructed, than others more capacious.</p>
                  <p>To prevent this Evil Cupping-glaſſes (with Scarification) are wont to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, but improperly; becauſe the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions are not by this means removed, but multiplied; and the diſtorted Veſſels are not reverted to their priſtine ſtate, but more diſtorted. Much better would be the Vapour aſcending from <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> ſet on fire; or a Fermentation made of Wine and Herbs abounding with Volatile Salt.</p>
                  <p>To prevent this Evil, when it is wont to infeſt the Tip of the Noſe, ſome apply Leeches, but evily; for I have known this Affect to be by them not a little exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; the reaſon of which Exaſperation I ſhould here add, were it not ſufficiently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the foregoing Paragraph.</p>
                  <p>This Affect is wont leiſurely to increaſe, but ſometimes it meets with another Evil, ſuddenly proceeding from intenſe Cold; and is called a <hi>Gangrene of Cold,</hi> which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning) is wont to be cured by Immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into cold Water. But is this a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal way of Cure? Yes, and conſentane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous both to Reaſon and Experience. Caſt a frozen Apple into cold Water, and you
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59518:131"/>ſhall ſee that (in a ſhort ſpace of time) to be thawed within, all the Ice adhering to the external Skin of the Apple, without loſs of its priſtine taſte, or former conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but ſet the ſame frozen Apple near a Fire, and it will preſently wither and loſe the ſweetneſs of its taſte.</p>
                  <p>Very many Particles, contained in the Pores and ſmall Paſſages of the congealed Apple, which before were fluid, have now (by reaſon of the Froſt) put on the form of Ice; that is, many Particles, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by the ſubtile matter ſufficiently ſtrong, were in their motions (each from other diverſe) continually agitated, do now reſt each with other, becauſe they are ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a ſubtile matter, which is too weak to conſerve them in their uſual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When ſuch a congealed Apple is caſt into cold Water, the more ſtrong part of the ſubtile matter, from the Water, flies into the Apple, and ſo thaws the ſame. But the more weak part of the ſubtile mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruſheth out of the Apple into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, moſt nearly touching the External Rind (or Skin) which is therefore covered over with Ice.</p>
                  <p>But when ſuch a frozen Apple is ſet to the Fire, the moſt ſubtile matter of the World, very ſtrong, and attended with many groſs particles of the burning Wood or Turf, endeavours (with great violence)
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59518:131"/>to enter the Pores of the congealed Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but cannot, becauſe the Pores are very much conſtringed with Cold; therefore it breaks them by force, and ſo the conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and good taſte of the Apple is changed and wholly ſpoiled.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is now ſufficiently manifeſt, that this Cure of a <hi>Gangrene</hi> from Cold is ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; though in the mean while it may perhaps ſeem fit to ſome to vary one Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, and that is as here following expreſſed. A congealed or frozen Apple is caſt into cold Water, and indeed well; becauſe the Liquor in a well-conſtituted Apple is found cold as to the touch; but our Bloud and Humors well conſtituted, are not cold to the touch, but warm; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Member lightly affected with a <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene</hi> from cold, ſhould rather be put into luke-warm-Water (by the <hi>Dutch</hi> called <hi>bloet-laeuw</hi>) than into cold.</p>

                     <p>Of an Atrophia, Imbecillity of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an Algor of the Arm.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Young man 24 years of age (as to all other things very well) had now
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59518:132"/>for ſix Months laboured with an <hi>Atrophia</hi> of his Left-arm, from the Shoulder to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and he could not lift up or otherwiſe move his Arm, but continually complained of an Algor (or extream coldneſs) thereof. Some Chyrurgeons had long attempted to cure this <hi>Affect.,</hi> according to their vulgar method; and applied their Plaiſters, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents; Linements, and other ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, but in vain.</p>
                  <p>The very viſcous Humor in the Arm of this Sick man, had produced not a few ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pertinaceous Obſtructions, whence the <hi>Aſtrophia</hi> of the Arm, its Impotency to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Algor of the ſame readily took beginning.</p>
                  <p>But this groſs Humor lay ſo very deep, that it could indeed be in no wiſe diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Unguents or other ſuch-like Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>Had the cure of this Evil been longer procraſtinated, there would have been great cauſe of fear, that the Ligaments, conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Shoulder-bone with the <hi>Scapula,</hi> would in a ſhort ſpace of time have been ſo much extended in length, that thence would have followed ſuch a Diſlocation of the Shoulder (moſt difficult to heal) as we deſcribed in the Laſt <hi>Obſervation</hi> of the Firſt <hi>Decade.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>A Young man, aged 30 years, walking in a very cold ſeaſon, was afflicted with dolour, redneſs, and tumor of the <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils</hi> and <hi>Uvula;</hi> whence he perceived diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in Swallowing, though he was (in the mean while) almoſt continually forced to ſwallow.</p>
                  <p>The Bloud in its ſmall Veſſels, and the Humors in the minute paſſages of the <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils</hi> and <hi>Uvula,</hi> ſtagnized (by reaſon of the cold Air admitted by Inſpiration) were coacervated and waxed acid; whence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe the aforeſaid tumor, dolour, redneſs, and difficulty of ſwallowing.</p>
                  <p>But whence did that ſo great Impulſe to ſwallowing derive its Original? I anſwer. The Membrane, ſubject to the <hi>Uvula,</hi> hath Nerves, which touched by the relaxed and incumbent <hi>Uvula,</hi> are the cauſe that the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59518:133"/>Nervous Juice is (in greater abundance) carried into the Muſcles adapted for ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>Being called to the ſick, I preſcribed the following <hi>Gargariſm.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>By this means our Patient was cured in a very ſhort time.</p>
                  <p>The preſcribed <hi>Gargariſm</hi> proved very profitable, becauſe it temperated the Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, diſſolved the coagulated Humors, and removed the Obſtructions.</p>
                  <p>I have in my ſelf often reſtored the <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vula</hi> relaxed, by reaſon of viſcous and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated Humors there ſtagnizing, when I gently touched the ſame with the tip of my Finger moiſtned onely with <hi>Spirit of Sal Armoniac:</hi> the reaſon of which Cure being more clear than the Sun at Noon, I ſhall not here add.</p>
                  <p>I remember moſt deſperate <hi>Quinſeys</hi> to have been often cured with a Decoction made with a fit Liquor, and Herbs contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much Volatile Salt; when the Vapour of the ſame, (boiling hot) the upper-part of the Head being well covered, aſcended into the Cavity of the Mouth, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſurrounded the whole Face and Neck.</p>

                     <p>Of an Hair Lip.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>A Female-Infant 14 days old, had from her Nativity laboured with an Hair-Lip (that is, with an open cleft of the Upper-Lip) miſerably disfiguring the Face of the Child, otherwiſe comely enough.</p>
                  <p>My Father being called, freed the Lip from the adjacent parts, that the Extreami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties might the better and more eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach each to other. Then he ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excoriated both the Extreamities of the Cloven-Lip, united them, and kept them u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited with three ſilver Needles, about which Threds were wreathed, to keep them ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59518:134"/>in their places. In the mean while the ends of the Needles were cut off with a fit Inſtrument, leſt they ſhould be infixed in the Bed-clothes, or other things, and ſo (taring in ſunder both Fleſh and Skin) fall or be forced out; as I remember to have happened more than once.</p>
                  <p>On the eighth day the Needles were drawn out, and both Extremities of the Hair-Lip grew together and were united; the Bloud and Humors performing their Circular Motion from one Extremity to the other. But the Holes made by the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles did as yet pour forth a little <hi>Pus;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly for no other reaſon, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Needles had remained too long infixed in the Lips. Wherefore my Father, when he afterward cured the like Affect in others, ſooner took out the <hi>Needles;</hi> and becauſe <hi>Silver Needles</hi> are no leſs liable to ruſt, than thoſe made of <hi>Steel,</hi> I therefore inſtead of <hi>Silver Needles</hi> uſed <hi>Steel Needles,</hi> becauſe they more eaſily perforate the Skin and Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>The moſt famous <hi>Sylvius</hi> would have an Hair-Lip cured without Needles, by the help of Plaiſters only; and I remember that a certain Chyrurgeon cured ſome young Patients by theſe means.</p>
                  <p>This Operation is uſually exerciſed in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants 14 days old: for if they be younger, they have fleſh ſo very ſoft, that it will (by
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59518:135"/>the leaſt irritation) be torn in ſunder by the Needles inherent; and in more maturity of age the Extreamities of the Hair-Lip will not ſo eaſily conglutinate.</p>
                  <p>But whence is it that Infants are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times born deformed with an Hair-Lip? Some aſcribe this wonderful Effect to the Imagination of the Mother; but others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſtifly deny this to be able to effect any thing.</p>
                  <p>In an Hens-Egg, before Incubation, ſome affirm that the Chick may (by a <hi>Microſcope</hi>) be ſeen compleatly formed: After the ſame manner in an Humane Egg (of which they ſay we are generated) the little Body of the Infant compleatly formed is contained; whether the ſame be intire, or affected with an Hair-Lip. But the matter is not thus ſufficiently elucidated, there muſt ſome reaſon be added, why in one humane Egg, rather than in an other; is generated a ſmall Body affected with an Hair-Lip. Yet throughly to ſearch out theſe things, is little or nothing conducent to the practice of Chyrurgy; therefore here we forbear to ſpeak further thereabout.</p>
